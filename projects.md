## Enlivening Technology

* How do we design convivial technologies which bring us closer to each other, our communities and ecologies?
* In a world where learning and relationships happen increasingly online and mediated by screens, how do we use technology in a balanced way, honoring our bodies, our senses, and our relationship to our surrounding ecology?


### Project: Enlivened Learning Web

> A new kind of Learning Management System (LMS) that is responsive to place-based learning and to the other needs of a regenerative and enlivened pedagogy through diverse and experimental modes of convivial and blended learning. The design principle of this technological platform is centered on democratic access, environmental impact and considers the limitations of access to computer resources and the Internet in different regions.
