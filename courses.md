  The Enlivened Cooperative weaves transformative experiences of un/learning, where connection blossoms, place-based wisdom awakens, and diverse ways of knowing and being come together.

Through the art of storytelling, hands-on workshops, and soul-nurturing tools, our experiences nurture the individual and collective well-being of all who come, shaping spaces where learning is shared and rooted in the land’s wisdom. Each experience reflects the values, pedagogy and approach of the Enlivened Cooperative, emphasising:

* _Relationality_ – learning by  weaving relations between all learners (including faculty);
* _Emplacement_ – nurturing inquiries, practices and attention towards place (and one´s own place) including the beyond human;
* _Cosmopolitical learning_ - including many ways of being-knowing-doing-relating, towards human becoming and possible worlds;
* _Buen Vivir and Responsibility_ - for the common flourishing and well-being of all beings.

The journeys (of varying length) are facilitated by practitioners from diverse backgrounds, representing an intentional range of diverse knowledge systems and experiences and involve workshops, presentations, storytelling, sharing practices, tools and methods which encourage learners to try out exercises and pursue inquiries in their own time and place.
