## Introduction

The southwest of Colombia is a diverse region full of contrasts. Mountains, valleys and coasts are home to the Nasa and Misak nations, and to the 
Afro-descendant populations rooted in the Pacific coast. 


In this region, Nasa and Misak nations plant the seed of desires and intentions in the Indigenous Guard -local authority named by the communities- 
to Take Care of Life collectively. The songs of the mayoras and mayores of the Black coast are sung to provide continuity to a life full of vitality and
joy -vivir sabroso- in the territory. Centuries of resistance are a constant celebration of life. 

Dancing as best as we can among the memories and survivals of the intense armed conflict of so many years in Colombia, today we are adjusting the rhythms
to pacify the territory in a beloved melody full of flavor. And if Cali is known for its salsa party, it is also a metropolis-region that welcomes these 
diverse sounds that are dreamed of composing the song of total peace.

As a society we are unlearning in circles, in dialogue. In circles of dances and in circles of peace. In and between communities. listening to us.

Join us on this journey to explore this motley celebration, dance in salsotecas and walk the Andes alongside the Nasa indigenous Guard. Meet with 
local communities, talk in circles with fire as the main listener. Join us to unlearn violence while we learn to Care for Life.

    
## Highlights

- Meet with Indigenous and Black communities leading processes of peace and reconciliation in the region and creating conditions to care for life in their territories and bodies.
- Participate in social technologies of conviviality and social change, guided by the contemporary insights of grassroots communities in the region.
- Experience the everyday practices of movement, joy and celebration of dignity that constitute the core of the vivir sabroso.
- Engage with the diversity of dances and songs that have made this region a world-renowned place of music, memory and collective wellbeing. 



## What is an un/learning journey?

The raw material of an un/learning journey is time. With care, we curate, knead, craft and, sometimes, even co-create it. 

They are an interruption, a slowing down, many openings. 

They are brave passages to possibilities, invitations to go out of the familiar zone and expand our sensibilities to let ourselves be undone so that we can suspend the noise of the routine and be attuned to dreams, stories and practices that instigate a process of becoming guided by the calm whisper and the joyous dance of the Earth. 

Unlike tourism, this is not about consuming experiences, places, or people. 

It is about engaging with the land and her guardians (human, non-human, more-than-human). 

It is about activating the memory that walks to the encounter of what is different -tastes, landscapes, textures, languages, rhythms, ways of knowing, modes of being- with curiosity and respect. 

The journey is simultaneously a retreat, a ceremony and a ritual that embraces the unknown as a fertile soil for radicalizing imagination and a pathway to deepen the relations to self, life, consciousness and the many worlds that constitute the pluriverse. 

## Who is this for?

The journeys are for those willing to participate in the co-creation of different stories, dreams and practices, for those searching to expand their 
horizons and attune their sensibilities and desires, for those daring to entertain an open mind and heart, holding contradictions with authenticity and 
making space for questions rather than answers. 

They are for those willing to explore who they really are and how to become present for the Earth in a mutually enhancing way.


We strongly encourage to apply for the program to everyone who feels called to join, especially to people of all ages with a serious commitment to 
re-inventing their relationship to Earth and to self, activists, artists, scientists, students, unschoolers, therapists, educators, farmers, community 
organizers, magicians, dropouts, writers, workers, and everyone resonating with the invitation to be present with the other worlds that are possible a
nd that are already here. 

## Itinerary

Dates: August 2nd-15th, 2023

### Day 1. Wednesday, August 2. Arrivals

![](/assets/img/courses/colombia/day-1.jpeg)

Arrivals to Cali. Transfer to our hotel. Meet your Learning Journey Team and fellow companions on the journey. Gather for a welcome talk, dinner and reception.

### Day 2. Thursday, August 3. Eco-neighborhood El Aguacatal and Andean dances

![](/assets/img/courses/colombia/day-2.jpeg)

We will get grounded as a group of fellow co-travelers, opening the heart space and getting to know each other in a deeper manner. We will open the space
with a ceremony and do a life-mapping session to share our life journeys and the questions that animate us in this moment.

Then we will share the day with the community collective from the Ecobarrio (eco-neighborhood) El Aguacatal, an urban territory where the permaculture 
is learned between gardens and “juntanzas” (slang for gatherings).

Later we will assist to Loma de la Cruz square to a ceremonial dance with the entire city, an open Andean Dances circle that takes place every week 
in this urban spot near downtown and old Cali.


### Day 3. Friday, August 4. Kwet Wala, Nasa communities at Pradera

![](/assets/img/courses/colombia/day-3.jpg)

We will drive to Kwet Wala´s community of La Fria, a Nasa community at the east side of the Cauca river valley at Pradera town, where we will meet with the
sages of the “resguardo”, who will share about the work towards a peaceful relationship between humans and territory, politics and spiritual inquiries 
offering a ceremony of health and love. We will stay in the community overnight.


### Day 4. Wednesday, Saturday, August 5. Botanic Garden at Silvia.

![](/assets/img/courses/colombia/day-4.jpg)

We will travel from Pradera to Silvia, driving up the cordilleras to this Andean town in the Cauca province´s North region, a primordial territory of the
Misak-Guambiana culture amid-others (mostly Nasa), and a constant node of Colombia’s conflicts. 

We will get to know about their cultural resistance through the people's voices and the experience of a Botanic Garden project that regenerated the 
community in spite of colonization violences and modern warfare. The garden is a project of experienced unlearnings/learnings evolving in a system 
that is as ancestral-local as permacultural with alternative radical education proposals. Misak are “learners” since the beginning so their “curriculum” 
starts from pregnancy. 
 

### Day 5. Sunday, August 6. Living with the Misak

![](/assets/img/courses/colombia/day-5.jpg)

We will connect and spend the day with the Misak community invited to work and experience with them their daily activities, as a “minga”. For example, 
we will have the opportunity to milk, or a workshop on wool cutting and artisanal spinning process with Misak cosmovision design, vegetables gardening, 
local bioconstruction and from sunset to night a healing session with music, traditional beverages and dialogues around the fire. 

#### Day 6. Monday, August 7. Universidad Misak and Misak Health House.


We will walk around the Resguardo (Misak communities in the same territory) to discover two community achievements.
The morning we will meet for dialogue with the learning community at Misak´s University house. We will participate in their learning fire circle and will have the opportunity to exchange experiences. We are invited to be Misak students.
In the afternoon we will have time to learn from the Misak Health House guides, a listening space of their wisdom about their plants and healing culture.


### Day 7. Tuesday, August 8. Andean paths, Cauca's province high mountains

![](/assets/img/courses/colombia/day-7.jpg)

We will have an optional walk to visit the sacred sites of the territory and there will be an offering ceremony with the accompaniment of the knowledgeable
Misak himself. Sylvia's farewell.
We will move to the neighboring municipality of Cajibío where we will rest overnight at the Atlántida ecovillage.


### Day 8. Wednesday, August 9. Atlántida ecovillage and Peace Dances

We will have a slow and resting journey with an afternoon meeting with the ecovillagers. The inhabitants of this intentional community have deepened their
spirituality in a project that has evolved for decades in the midst of regional confrontations into a learning center of Colombian environmentalists and
vanguard networks. The ecovillage has become lately a Peace Dance´s event center of international relevance.


### Day 9. Thursday, August 10. Caloto and Nasa community

![](/assets/img/courses/colombia/day-9.jpeg)

We will drive to the Northern limit of the province to Caloto municipality where we will meet with the Guardia Indígena (Indigenous Guard) at one Nasa´s
learning centers, a community for children, youth, men, women and elders that represent the resistance and communitary force for autonomous governance and 
observation. We will stay in the community overnight.

### Day 10. Friday, August 11. Nasa ceremony for the Indigenous Guard

We will share the day with the Guardia Indígena´s former guides, having an accompanied journey with children and youth of Caloto community that decided to
join the force to defend their Nasa culture.
At night we will join a ceremonial event to congrat achievements and discuss novelties. An opportunity to enjoy dances, food and cultural Nasa celebrations.


### Day 11. Saturday, August 12. From high mountains to the ocean: Punta Soldado island.

![](/assets/img/courses/colombia/day-11.jpeg)


Andean cordillera's farewell. We will travel by land to Buenaventura, the most important port-city of the Pacific region. where we will take a fast boat to
Punta Soldado, a neighboring Afro-Colombian community settled on a close island. We will be delighted as we take in the tropical abundance that Colombian
geography can offer from its different altitudes. It will be just a few hours travel in a 2000 mt descent to sea level. We will stay on the island-community
overnight.

### Day 12. Sunday, August 13. Living with Punta Soldado's people


In this Afro-Colombian settlement we will share with locals at their own rhythm, through dances that they learned before first steps and music that elder’s
voices perform to guide a family-collective system. We will listen to their African knowledge embedded within the port culture that brings the nation and
world together in this small fisherman’s community. With overwhelming ecological challenges and an example of peace achievements, Puerto Soldado is an 
authentic resistance locality in the middle of an abused and violated paradise.

### Day 13. Monday, August 14. From Punta Soldado to Old Cali

![](/assets/img/courses/colombia/day-13.jpeg)


We will take the fast boat back to land and drive to Cali, where we will spend the evening and night walking through the old city and some cultural venues
of this capital of cultures, salsa and artistic traditions.

### Day 14. Tuesday, August 15. Siloé neighborhood uprisings, memorials, museum and ceremonial closure dialogues. Salsa party and last unlearning journey dance

![](/assets/img/courses/colombia/day-14.jpg)


We will spend all day at the Popular Museum from Siloé and around the neighborhood, hosted by its founders. We will have a walk around the communitary space
s born after the social uprising of 2021. These events have made this urban community a reference of Colombia’s present history and painful memories. 
This is an anti-museum where you can get involved with memory and touch. We will share lunch with the locals and we will close our 2-week  journey in a 
circle ceremony until the sun sets. 
At night we will surely have enough energy to go and dance at the best Salsotecas of the world. A Cali must. 

### Day 15. Bye, bye. Petronio Álvarez Pacific Music Festival (August 16-21)

Farewell day, departures from Cali international airport or Cali Bus Terminal. Even though… 
… we HIGHLY RECOMMEND to stay and enjoy the biggest Colombian festival, the best dance-journey!
FESTIVAL DE MÚSICA DEL PACÍFICO PETRONIO ÁLVAREZ
We advise to book your flights after you spend at least a couple of nights at this music festival. We can help you find very nice lodging.

# Ecopedagogy and travelling

Before, during and after the journey we exercise a cosmopolitical pedagogy of emergence (COPE). We understand cosmopolitics as an exercise of ‘slowing down
reasoning’ (Stengers) that creates an opening for possible articulations between worlds. In this sense, it is a pedagogy of encounter, of sourcing inner 
wisdom, of dialogue between cultures and world-making practices, one that involves movement, story, dreams, inquiries, solidarities, boundaries and 
practices that allow for the uniqueness of the process of coming into being, of a becoming that invites a new relationship of the human within an entangled,
endangered yet potent web of life. 

Before the journey, registered participants will get access to a platform with resources on different topics of the journey, such as: Colombian history,
Nasa's politics of Liberation of Mother Earth, Misak cosmovision, designs for autonomy in the region, and alternatives to development. These are materials
and resources that learners can engage freely, at their own rhythm and with no expected outcome. Participants are invited to choose one topic of inquiry
during their journey that is relevant and alive for them.

During the journey, we will have a combination of visits, group process sessions, lectures, practices and free time. Participants are invited to document
their journey in the way that suits them better for their learning process.

## Cost

As a cooperative, we are trying new approaches to make the journeys affordable for as many people as possible while covering the costs and paying our 
faculty and hosts. We are experimenting with a sliding scale in which you can choose the fee according to your life situation. 

Consider contributing MORE on the scale if you:

- belong to a sponsoring organization or are employed full-time
- have investments, retirement accounts, or inherited money
- travel recreationally
- have access to family money and resources in times of need
- work part-time by choice
- own the home you live in
- have a relatively high degree of earning power due to level of education (or gender and racial privilege, class background, etc.)

Consider contributing LESS on the scale if you.

- have difficulty covering basic expenses
- are supporting children or have other dependents
- have significant debt
- have medical expenses not covered by insurance
- are an elder with limited financial support
- are an unpaid community organizer
- have unstable housing and/or limited access to reliable transportation
- have not taken a vacation or time off due to the financial burden

(This is based on the ‘Green Bottle’ sliding scale model by Alexis J. Cunningfolk | www.wortsandcunning.com)

If you select an amount at the higher end of the scale, you will make possible future offerings and support the good work of the speakers, facilitators, and organizers who are generously contributing their gifts to this event.

## Faculty and team: 


**Camilo Bossio**, 

![](/assets/img/courses/andes/000004.jpg){:.right.thumb width="250"}

**Gerardo López-Amaro**, co-founder of the Enlivened Cooperative, is currently walking  the path of autonomous education with the task of imagining spaces of encounter for thinking-feeling together about ways to strengthen the defense of life, memory and territory. He sees this as part of a planetary struggle for cognitive, relational and ontological justice. He is purposefully becoming entangled in a great “we” of people enacting the pluriverse, that “world where many worlds fit.” Born and raised in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, he’s a pilgrim of viable spaces informed by politics of love and consciousness regarding the healing of land and territory, love and intimacy, and labor and livelihood.
