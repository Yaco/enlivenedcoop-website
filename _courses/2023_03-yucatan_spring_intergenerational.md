# Interbeing Learning Journey Yucatán (Spring 2023, intergenerational edition)

1. this ordered seed list will be replaced by the toc
{:toc}

The Interbeing Un/Learning Journeys are an invitation to travel otherwise. By interrupting the realm of the known and the familiar, participants benefit from a time that is crafted to engage with the land and the body. This experience sparks a collective conversation that expands sensibilities and practices in, against and beyond development and leadership. In doing so, we nurture the possibility of relating kindly to the Earth and the Earthlings.

We want to do this by co-creating an intergenerational space, where families with kids can come, travel, play, look at the stars, wonder and reflect together. Children are explicitly welcomed as an essential part of this un/learning experience.  

The Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico is a privileged witness of the last mass extinction event, caused by the impact of the Chicxulub asteroid. It shelters the mysteries of cosmic events sculpted as cenotes, windows to the underground. Jungles, lagoons and the ocean are home to vibrant and endangered communities of life. Similarly, it preserves the memories of ancient cities built by peoples who were and are some of the most prestigious observers of the stars and life cycles, the Mayans.

Embraced by the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, the Peninsula has a strong relationship with rich and threatened marine ecosystems, including the second largest coral reef in the world, the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef.

The Yucatan is home to an intercultural society facing very complex challenges. The economy is driven by extractivist tourism, attracting crowds enchanted by the beauties of the jungles, beaches, and villages of this region while overlooking the damage of a development model that is polluting on a vast scale, devastating mangroves and jungles, endangering species and ecosystems, and deepening social inequalities and injustice.

This is an invitation to undoing tourism and development and a provocation to learn to be good visitors, setting aside the Western sense of neo-colonizing entitlement and focusing on the attuning of sensibilities, journeying together, holding the inevitable contradictions and caring for the nourishment of local communities, land and waters that will host us, as well as for the lands and waters where we travelers usually dwell.

## Itinerary

March 12th-23rd, 2023

![](/assets/img/courses/yucatan_fall/yucatan_fall-01.jpg){:.thumb}

### Day 1. Sunday, March 12. Arrivals

### Day 2. Monday, March 13. Chemuyil

![](/assets/img/courses/yucatan_fall/yucatan_fall-09.jpg){:.thumb}

Here we will do an opening ceremony in a geodesic dome in the jungle, sharing our intentions and grounding ourselves while getting to know each other and the intentions for our journey. We will allow space for a silent walk in the jungle, a silence to listen and be truly present to the web of life that wraps us and that we are. A trail will lead us to a cenote, with the invitation to look to the inner world of Earth. Back in Chemuyil we will enjoy a special dinner of traditional local food.

### Day 3. Tuesday, March 14. Chemuyil-Bacalar

![](/assets/img/courses/yucatan_fall/yucatan_fall-13.jpg){:.thumb}

We will spend the morning by the Caribbean beach of Xcacel, a nature reserve and sanctuary of the turtle. After lunch, we will drive for 2:45 hours to the lagoon of Bacalar, with its gorgeous water with incredible shades of blue. 

### Day 4. Wednesday, March 15. Bacalar

![](/assets/img/courses/yucatan_fall/yucatan_fall-06.jpg){:.thumb}

We will have a full day of rest and regeneration by the lagoon. Sailing, becoming pirates, kayaking in the near mangroves, cooking together, aqua therapy and temazcal are some of the optional activities for the day.

### Day 5. Thursday, March 16. Bacalar/Xul Ha

We will visit the nearby lagoon of Xul Ha, home to the stromatolites, one of the most ancient forms of life on Earth, responsible for increasing the amount of oxygen in the primeval atmosphere through their continuing photosynthesis. They were the first known organisms to photosynthesize and produce free oxygen, changing radically the possibilities for life on our planet.  We will regroup in the evening in the lagoon of Bacalar for a group sharing.


### Day 6. Friday, March 17. Bacalar/Calakmul

We will spend our last morning in the lagoon and after lunch we will travel for 1h30 to the Reserve of the Biosphere Calakmul, where we will camp in the second largest jungle remnant in the American continent after the Amazon. 

### Day 7. Saturday, March 18. Calakmul

![](/assets/img/courses/yucatan_fall/yucatan_fall-14.jpg){:.thumb}

Very early in the morning, we will do a short hike where we will admire the abundance of life in the jungle. With luck, we will be able to spot guacamayas, tucans, wild turkeys, deers and many other species. After this, we will visit the archaeological site of Calakmul, one of the largest and most powerful ancient Mayan cities. We will spend the night in the area.

### Day 8. Sunday, March 19. Calakmul/Cenotillo

![](/assets/img/courses/yucatan_fall/yucatan_fall-11.jpg){:.thumb}

After lunch, we will travel for 6 hours to reach Cenote Xooch, one of the most impressive cenotes in the region, with an underground pool diameter of approximately 60m, surrounded by exuberant, breathtaking nature. In this unparalleled location we will camp, play and learn about the Ring of Cenotes, a 180km-diameter semicircular band of abundant karst sinkholes which coincides with the concentric ring of the Chicxulub structure, caused by the impact of the asteroid, an event that reshaped the history of our planet and the majority of her species.

### Day 9. Monday, March 20. Cenote Xooch/Chichén Itzá

![](/assets/img/courses/yucatan_fall/yucatan_fall-03.jpg){:.thumb}

In the morning, we will have time to enjoy swimming in the Cenote Xooch and have lunch in the local town of Cenotillo. In the afternoon, we will visit Chichén Itzá, in time for the Spring equinox and the descent of the serpent in the Temple of Kukulkán. Chichén Itzá is considered the most important archaeological vestige of the Maya-Toltec civilization in Yucatan (10th-15th centuries). Its monuments are among the undisputed masterpieces of Mesoamerican architecture because of the beauty of their proportions, the refinement of their construction and the splendor of their sculpted decorations that have made it one of the Wonders of the World. We will visit this ancient city with the help of a local expert, learning about archeo-astronomy. We will spend the night in Ek Balam.

### Day 10. Tuesday, March 21. Ek Balam

![](/assets/img/courses/yucatan_fall/yucatan_fall-12.jpg){:.thumb}

## Reasons to participate

You have an interest in:

Learning to be a good visitor.

Becoming aware of the individualistic, neo-colonizing, extractivist and consumerist logic of tourism, developing an approach that is sensible with the land, the people and the communities of life that host us as travelers.

Becoming present for the Earth in a mutually beneficial way.

Delving into indigenous and peasant wisdom and scientific breakthroughs, exercising presence and exploring old new ways of relating to the web of life, including but not limited to our selves.

Participating in localized, place-based, embodied, experiential learning that expands sensibilities and imagination.

Cultivating spaces for other ways of knowing and being -aside from mainstream, disembodied, fragmented knowledge- which are highly relevant for the current challenges of our time.

Unfolding a self and collective inquiry leading to the birth of new practices and stories.

Co-creating a space for deepening artistic explorations.

Meeting fellow travelers with kindred interests and mutual inspiration .

## Ecopedagogy and travelling

The values, pedagogy and approach of the Enlivened Cooperative in this journey emphasize:

* _Relationality_ – learning by weaving relations between all learners (including faculty);
* _Emplacement_ – nurturing inquiries, practices and attention towards place (and one´s own place) including the beyond human;
* _Cosmopolitical learning_ - including many ways of being-knowing-doing-relating, towards human becoming and possible worlds, slowing down reasoning;
* _Buen Vivir and Responsibility_ - for the common flourishing, alivelihoods and well-being of all beings, which calls for a reinvention of the human and the tending to new stories and practices, particularly of those directly participating in the shared learning experience.

Before the journey, registered participants will get access to a platform with resources on different topics of the journey, such as: Mayan culture, the Chicxulub event, Deep Time perspective, anti-tourism and radical hospitality, marine life ecosystems, archeoastronomy and indigenous peoples resistance to extractivist models of development. These are materials and resources that learners can engage freely, at their own rhythm and with no expected outcome. Participants are invited to choose one topic of inquiry during their journey that is relevant and alive for them.

During the journey, we will have a combination of visits, group process, lectures, practices and free time. Participants are invited to document their journey in the way that suits them better for their learning process.

## Ethics and economy

As a cooperative, we believe in offering programs that help you, your community and the world be enlivened again. We strive to co-create regenerative livelihoods for our families and for the planet. We refuse to engage in deadlihoods and we engage in initiatives that support alivelihoods, regenerating ourselves, the earth’s natural systems and local healthy families and communities.

We adopt the three principles of permaculture: Care for the Earth, Care for the People and Fair Share. We embrace the idea of surplus being shared with everyone involved in making the journey possible. We assign 40% of the profits of the journey to the cooperative, 10% for a local project aligned with this vision, and 50% to be proportionally divided between the team that carried out the project.
By participating in this journey, you support an effort to engage with equity and social and environmental justice, supporting localized circular economies, exploring more regenerative economic practices, helping a democratically run cooperative, and enhancing the practice of being a grateful guest of Earth.

## Faculty and team:

![](/assets/img/courses/yucatan_fall/amaro.jpg){:.right.thumb width="250"}

**Gerardo López-Amaro**, co-founder of the Enlivened Cooperative, is currently walking com-passionately the path of autonomous education with the task of imagining spaces of encounter for thinking-feeling together about ways to strengthen the defense of life, memory and territory. He sees this as part of a planetary struggle for cognitive, relational and ontological justice. He is purposefully becoming entangled in a great “we” of people enacting the pluriverse, that “world where many worlds fit.” He has a profound interest in intercultural translation as a political practice with the horizon of weaving together an anti-imperial, decolonizing, joyful South that can resist the current capitalist storm and create stories, practices, and ideas that nurture life and dignity. Born and raised in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, he’s a pilgrim of viable spaces informed by politics of love and consciousness regarding the healing of land and territory, love and intimacy, and labor and livelihood. These topics constitute his field of inquiry for his doctoral dissertation research in Anthropology and Social Change at the California Institute of Integral Studies.

**Udi Mandel** has 20 years of experience teaching social anthropology and sustainability in higher education and collaborating with communities in Europe, the Pacific, North and Latin America. Udi’s focus is on issues of social, ecological and epistemic justice with an emphasis on regenerative practices that can bring human and ecological flourishing. Udi’s work combines action research, writing, filmmaking and community collaborations in a range of settings,  including diverse indigenous communities, social and ecological movements from around the world. Udi received his PhD in social anthropology from Goldsmiths College (University of London), an MSc in international development from the University of Bristol, and an MFA from the University of Edinburgh. Udi has held faculty appointments at EARTH University (Costa Rica), the University of Bristol (UK), and the University of Oxford and other institutions in the UK and US. Udi co-founded with others the Enlivened Learning Project and the Ecoversities Alliance, an international alliance of learning places committed to social and ecological justice and regeneration. Udi is also a co-founder of the Enlivened Cooperative.

**Bernardo Sánchez Lapuente** is a Social Anthropologist, Theater Educator and Photographer. Beyond titles and credentials, Bernardo is an Artist, Dad of two awesome girls, traveler and world bridger. He develops his work within the framework of Art Education with kids and youth, as well as accompanying group processes. He feels fascinated with the idea of traveling throughout the planet that we inhabit while also journeying throughout the infinite geography that inhabits us. He will be in charge of generating spaces and moments to put into common ground the discoveries and questions of the journey.

**Stephan Martin** is an astronomer, educator, and author who has taught astronomy, physics, and consciousness studies at colleges, universities, and learning centers across the US for over twenty-five years. Between 2003-2008 he studied directly with Brian Swimme and others at the California Institute of Integral Studies, out of which came his first book Cosmic Conversations, in which he held dialogues with scientists, spiritual teachers, and cultural creatives on the nature of the universe and our role in it. Since then he has led workshops on the New Cosmology at seminars and retreat centers across the US and Europe and has been active in exploring multidisciplinary approaches to exploring the universe. He is currently adjunct faculty in the Consciousness and Transformative Studies graduate program at John F Kennedy University where he teaches a course on “Cosmology and Consciousness.” Steve is also a co-director of the continuing care program at the Center for Spiritual Emergence in Asheville, NC where he assists clients in living more conscious lives from an expansive perspective.

**Pedro Uc Be** is a poet and a defender of the Mayan territory in Yucatan. Born in Buctzotz, he is the author of several books and a recipient of different awards. For Pedro, poetry and the care for the land are the same, a deep root that is entangled to his relationship to the milpa. His proposal is to share Mayan philosophy, thought and emotion a a proposal of life, of survival, of joy and of health.

**Haizel de la Cruz**, Born in Ticul and currently living in Buctzotz. A young photographer that documents the Mayan resistance and the vitality of an ethics of care for life. A ceiba tree, that represents life, time, space and community for Mayan was the first image that she captured with her cellphone. And her world moved.

## About the Interbeing Learning Journeys series

> "If you are a poet, you will see clearly that there is a cloud floating in this sheet of paper. Without a cloud, there will be
> no rain; without rain, the trees cannot grow: and without trees, we cannot make paper. The cloud is essential for the paper to
> exist. If the cloud is not here, the sheet of paper cannot be here either. So we can say that the cloud and the paper
>inter-are."

_Thich Nhat Hahn, Clouds in Each Paper_

We humans do not exist independently in an isolated triumphant alienated bubble. The Interbeing Learning Journeys are an
opportunity to explore interconnected issues of non-anthropocentric time and ways of being, of self and consciousness, of
ancient and modern knowledge, following the paths of stars, water, and peoples. In journeying from place to place we also travel
within, re-creating new stories and tapping into unknown sensibilities, possibilities and purposes for each participant.

The journeys are for those willing to participate in the co-creation of different stories, dreams and practices, for those
searching to expand their horizons and attune their sensibilities and desires, for those daring to entertain an open mind and
heart, holding contradictions with authenticity and making space for questions rather than answers. They are for those willing
to explore who they really are and how to become present for the Earth in a mutually enhancing way.

This is an invitation for travelers looking to go to the encounter of relations and “worlding practices”, complex interactions
between human and non-human beings that constitute, care or disrupt the web of life. It is an opportunity to learn from stars,
water, and from people in their vital territories. The main focus of inquiry of travel is to learn what kinds of worlds are
enacted, through what practices, and with what consequences for what beings, both in the places we visit and also in the places
where the travelers usually dwell.

In times of multiple crises, contradictions and nonsense,

it is important to slow down and take a pause to look at the stars and the messages that they hold about the evolution of the
pluriverse, consciousness and life;

it is important to slow down and take a pause to take care of water and the history, flows, and nourishment that she provides
for the multiple threads of the web of life in our shared home, our planet;

it is important to slow down and take a pause to listen to the wisdom of people who have cultivated a respectful relationship
with the Earth -indigenous peoples, peasants, women, artists and environmentalists- in order to gain emplaced insights about our
re-invention as human species; and

it is important to slow down and take a pause to breathe and tap into the rhythms, movements and creations of interbeing, and
experience embodied learnings about how to become present for the Earth with reciprocity and care.
