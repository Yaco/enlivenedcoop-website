From origins in Mesoamerican societies to today’s global commodity chains cacao has continuously shaped and been shaped by the communities it has grown with. What is the allure of this tree, its spiritual and medicinal value, how has the ecology, farming practices, processing and cooking of cacao and been transformed over the centuries? What impact has cacao had in the societies it has encountered? What human cultures has this tree gathered around it (such as: Mesoamerican, Afro Caribbean, industrial processing, transnational cooperative solidarity economies, regenerative agroforestry, craft chocolatiers) and what is the potential for learning across these cultures for a weaving of worlds towards social-ecological wellbeing?

This (for now) online 10 week course will engage with these questions and bring together representatives from these different cultures and areas of expertise towards a holistic engagement with cacao and chocolate. The 2h weekly sessions, with at least two facilitators from different cultures/knowledges, will share different outlooks, stories, experiences, inquiries and practices. Through the lens of cacao and its relation to these cultures, learners will try out practical exercises and practices (including recipes) at home and explore their own place, ecology and community. Learners will grow the weeks through the perspective of a tree and mycelia from the kernel of cacao towards the present moment of planetary alliances of solidarity and affinity chains of cacao.

Combining the stories, experiences and practices of chocolatiers (including the many stages of making chocolate), cacao growers, and cacao rebels with historical, political-economic and political-ecological overviews. Though the course is at this point online, it will mix tasting sessions sourced from different regions and chocolatiers with cacao ceremony from mesoamerica traditions, agro-ecological practices of growing cacao with fermentation and cooking sessions, theory and history with listening to plants and pollinators.


## Theme

Learning through/with cacao/ecology/human relationships, addressing the encounters between these beings, the transformations they have mutually undergone, the struggles and communities which have built up around these processes and the emerging webs of solidarity for eco-social wellbeing.

### How

Enacting the values and pedagogy of the Enlivened Cooperative of:

* Relationality: learning by  weaving relations between all learners (including faculty) and...
* Emplacement: nurturing inquiries, practices and attention towards place (and one´s own place) including the beyond human...
* Cosmopolitical learning: including many ways of being-knowing-doing-relating, towards human becoming and possible worlds… (in this case indigenous Bribri, Zapotec and Mayan, Afro-Caribbean, artisanal chocolatiers, agro-ecological, anthropological, political ecological/economic, amongst others).
* Buen Vivir and Responsibility - for the common flourishing of all beings

## Topics

Week 1- Orientation – Decolonial and Enlivened learning (How), Faculty and Topics and the Coop.
