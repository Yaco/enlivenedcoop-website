From its origins in Mesoamerican societies to today’s global commodity chains, cacao has continuously shaped and been shaped by the communities it has grown with. What is the allure of this tree, its spiritual and medicinal value? How has the ecology, farming practices, processing and cooking of cacao and been transformed over the centuries? What impact has cacao had in the societies it has encountered? What human cultures has this tree gathered around it (such as: Mesoamerican, Afro Caribbean, industrial processing, transnational cooperative solidarity economies, regenerative agroforestry, craft chocolatiers) and what can we learn from these cultures about social-ecological wellbeing?

This online 12 week course will engage with these questions and bring together representatives from these different cultures and areas of expertise towards a holistic engagement with cacao and chocolate. The 2 hour weekly sessions with facilitators from different cultures/knowledge systems, will share different tastings, outlooks, stories, experiences, inquiries and practices. Through the lens of cacao and its relation to these cultures, learners will experience different phases of the chocolate making process (from bean to bar), try out exercises and practices (including recipes) and tastings at home and explore their own place - local ecology and community through a series of invited tasks. Learners will grow through the weeks within a perspective of a cacao tree and its mycelia from the kernel of cacao towards the present moment of planetary alliances of solidarity and affinity chains of chocolate.

## Dates and times

### Members

#### Udi Mandel (Course curator, Enlivened Cooperative)

A life-long Chocolate lover, it was during my time living in Costa Rica and working at EARTH University (an agroecology university) that I got to more intimately know the world of cacao and chocolate, working with farmers and chocolatiers, from a variety of backgrounds, and helping to set up the [Chocolate Coast](https://www.costadelchocolate.com) alliance of those working with Cacao and chocolate in the Caribbean region. The vision of the Chocolate Coast was to create a collaborative alliance, centered on Cacao and chocolate, towards localized social, cultural and economic regeneration. The other experience that informs my approach as curator of this course (which I am tentatively calling cosmopolitical learning) is that of bringing together different ways of being-knowing-doing-relating and inhabiting to engage with the contemporary world’s more pressing problems we face. This approach is seen in the [Ecoversities Alliance](https://ecoversities.org), as well as the Enlivened Cooperative, both of which I helped to found.


#### Edgardo Garcia & Areli (Cooperativa CACAO)

We are Cooperativa CACAO, which means Autonomous Cooperative of Sharing and Learning of Oaxaca. The cooperative was born in August 2013. We are a group of young people who organize ourselves with the objectives of: contributing to the food sovereignty of our families and communities through cocoa, artisan chocolate and creating tools for self-management (autogestión) and autonomy. Through our work we want to contribute to the strengthening of agroforestry systems in the Sierra Sur, Chinantla and Costa de Oaxaca, in addition to valuing the peasant way of life, heal the social fabric of our communities, generate networks of local producers, revalue cocoa and chocolate as a food - medicine and not as a candy. For us, cocoa and artisan chocolate are symbols of the joyful rebellion and resistance of our native peoples. We want a chocolate that gives us strength to fight for food sovereignty.

#### Edgar Campbel (Afrocacao)

Finca Don Edgar, is a farm with almost 100 years of history. My parents cultivated Cacao and different ground food, which was sent to the market in Limón by boat at that time. At the end of the 1970’s our main crop got infected by the fungus called “monilia” which broke our economy., Oour farm was almost destroyed, because of the lack of knowledge to deal with this sickness, so we looked for other ways of living, migrating to the cities, looking for jobs. After almost 40 years, during which time I became a teacher, was president of the Costa Rica Teachers Union and had other roles in the field of education, I retired and returned to rescue our farm. Applying new knowledge and working with research centers, we have sought to rehabilitate the cacao, and put our farm to work from an agroecological approach, trying to reconstruct our “cacao culture” by remembering and sharing the knowledge of our ancestral customs, using our farm as a school, planting our “first aid kits” remembering our “gastronomy” researching about “grandma's recipes” and using our farm as a tourist sightseeing place, where we share the beauty of Nature and our History through Cacao.

#### Kerstin Roos

Kerstin’s chocolate journey began when she was seven, and had just moved to Canada from Germany. She missed her favourite chocolate treats so much that she vowed to one day make chocolate like the chocolate she loved back in her country of birth. This dream remained dormant until, at age 30, Kerstin made a career move into the culinary world while living in NYC. She began taking chocolate making classes and started honing her skills as a chocolatier. In 2005 she opened a chocolate shop in Edmonton, Canada and created a line of chocolate confections called Chocophilia. She also offered chocolate workshops that included sensory education.  After studying the history of cacao and the culture around it, she became fascinated by the cacao farmers and their communities.  In 2012 she closed her shop so she could travel with her family to different cacao growing regions around the world.  In 2015,  Kerstin started grad school at the School for International Training in Brattleboro, VT and completed a master’s degree in sustainable development focusing on issues of equity in the cocoa supply chain.  She currently lives in Vermont with her family and offers hands-on workshops for women that involve chocolate making and therapeutic uses of cacao.

#### Andreas Cordero (Morena Clara)

Morena Clara is an integrated farm that is dedicated to the production and recovery of cacao, which is transformed into chocolate shells, jewelry, drinks, nibs, etc. In 2017 we started with a hectare of land in Talamanca, Limón with cacao varieties donated by the Inter-American Foundation under the tutelage of the Talamanca Caribe Biological Corridor. We planted using a novel ethnohistoric and agroforestry recovery system combining cocoa with fruit trees, timber, medicinal and aromatic plants; most of them, used for decades in the homes of the Afro-descendant population in the area. Experiencing the loss of values ​​and lack of instruction that the young population receives regarding the crops of their ancestors, a project began to develop, not only agricultural but also educational, which included local youth and women heads of households who promote the transmission of healthy and harmonious relations with the environment.
At the Morena Clara farm the entire process is learned in a dynamic and experiential way from the tree to bar, organic practices have been developed that guarantee healthy fruits with good taste and a final product of quality. During these four years our objective has been to show the productive opportunity in the canton of Talamanca and to educate the new generations who are learning about the history, culture and production of excellent cocoa. We maintain a friendly relationship with the environment and seek spaces to have a better quality of life.
