## In a nutshell

![](/assets/img/courses/yucatan_fall/day-6.png)


Our 10-day journey across the peninsula of Yucatan is an experiential dive into a multiplicity of ecosystems -jungles, caves,
cenotes, mangroves, lagoons and underground rivers. Maya people have dwelled in these lands from about 4500 years ago, developing
a rich knowledge, experiences, ethics and ways of being that have emerged from this intimate relationship with the territory. Engaging
with this vast cosmology invites us to deepen our understandings and our sensibility for a world composed of rich kinships.

The program is designed to hold space in depth and breadth for individual and collective inquiry of systemic change and expansion of
ways of dwelling, thinking, listening and feeling. In our un/learning journey we will engage in conversation with local communities
of caretakers of the territory and of biodiversity, learning with the bees, the seeds, the winds and the jaguars, as well as with
our intuitions and creative spaces. The program invites space for embodied and movement practices, sharing and creation of rituals,
word circles and storytelling. 

We will convene first in the jungle of Chemuyil, halfway between Playa del Carmen and Tulum, for a general presentation of the
journey and of the biocultural diversity of the peninsula of Yucatan. During the following days, we will visiting some of the
most inspiring initiatives of revitalization of Maya thought and wisdom, engaging in dialogue with local communities cultivating
memory, rituals, native seeds, indigenous medicine, and forms of governance. We will also meet local activists known for their
contributions in conservation, art, and community organizing.

# Ecopedagogy and travelling

Before, during and after the journey we exercise a cosmopolitical pedagogy of emergence (COPE). We understand cosmopolitics as
an exercise of ‘slowing down reasoning’ (Stengers) that creates an opening for possible articulations between worlds. In this
sense, it is a pedagogy of encounter, of sourcing inner wisdom, of dialogue between cultures and world-making practices, one
that involves movement, story, dreams, inquiries, solidarities, boundaries and practices that allow for the uniqueness of the
process of coming into being, of a becoming that invites a new relationship of the human within an entangled, endangered yet
potent web of life. 

Participants are invited to choose one topic of inquiry during their journey that is relevant and alive for them.

During the journey, we will have a combination of visits, group process sessions, lectures, practices and free time. 
Participants are invited to document their journey in the way that suits them better for their learning process.

![](/assets/img/courses/yucatan_fall/day-2.jpg)


## Languages

We will be using Maya, Spanish, and English throughout our journey. Translation into these languages will be offered by the team. 

![](/assets/img/courses/yucatan_fall/yucatan_fall-13.jpg)

## Number of participants

As we aim to offer personalized support, we only have space for the participation of 10 people on this call.

## Cost

As a cooperative, we are trying new approaches to make the journeys affordable for as many people as possible while covering 
the costs and paying our faculty and hosts, as well as making generous donations to local regenerative projects. We are 
experimenting with a sliding scale in which you can choose the fee according to your life situation. 

Consider contributing MORE on the scale if you:

- have the ability to comfortably meet all of your basic needs
- belong to a sponsoring organization or are employed full-time
- have investments, retirement accounts, or inherited money
- travel recreationally
- have access to family money and resources in times of need
- work part-time by choice
- own the home you live in
- have a relatively high degree of earning power due to level of education (or gender and racial privilege, class background, etc.)

Consider contributing LESS on the scale if you.

- have difficulty covering basic expenses
- are supporting children or have other dependents
- have significant debt
- have medical expenses not covered by insurance
- are an elder with limited financial support
- are an unpaid community organizer
- have unstable housing and/or limited access to reliable transportation
- have not taken a vacation or time off due to the financial burden

(This is based on the ‘Green Bottle’ sliding scale model by Alexis J. Cunningfolk | www.wortsandcunning.com)

If you select an amount at the higher end of the scale, you will make possible future offerings and support the good work of the speakers, facilitators, and organizers who are generously contributing their gifts to this event. You will also be contributing to the partial grants fund for those needing financial support.

- Basic fee: $1,600 USD in shared accommodation in tent or accommodation provided by the community. 

We require a non-refundable deposit of $500 USD to book your spot.

## What is an un/learning journey?

The raw material of an un/learning journey is time. With care, we curate, knead, craft and, sometimes, even co-create it. 

They are an interruption, a slowing down, many openings. 

They are brave passages to possibilities, invitations to go out of the familiar zone and expand our sensibilities to let ourselves be undone so that we can suspend the noise of the routine and be attuned to dreams, stories and practices that instigate a process of becoming guided by the calm whisper and the joyous dance of the Earth. 

Unlike tourism, this is not about consuming experiences, places, or people. 

It is about engaging with the land and her guardians (human, non-human, more-than-human). 

It is about activating the memory that walks to the encounter of what is different -tastes, landscapes, textures, languages, rhythms, ways of knowing, modes of being- with curiosity and respect. 

The journey is simultaneously a retreat, a ceremony and a ritual that embraces the unknown as a fertile soil for radicalizing imagination and a pathway to deepen the relations to self, life, consciousness and the many worlds that constitute the pluriverse. 

![](/assets/img/courses/yucatan_fall/yucatan_fall-14.jpg)

## Who is this for?

The journeys are for those willing to participate in the co-creation of different stories, dreams and practices, for those searching to expand their horizons and attune their sensibilities and desires, for those daring to entertain an open mind and heart, holding contradictions with authenticity and making space for questions rather than answers. They are for those willing to explore who they really are and how to become present for the Earth in a mutually enhancing way.

We strongly encourage to apply for the program to everyone who feels called to join, especially to people of all ages with a serious commitment to re-inventing their relationship to Earth and to self, activists, artists, scientists, students, unschoolers, therapists, educators, farmers, community organizers, magicians, dropouts, writers, workers, and everyone resonating with the invitation to be present with the other worlds that are possible and that are already here.

## Ethics and economy

As a cooperative, we believe in offering programs that help you, your community and the world be enlivened again. We strive to co-create regenerative livelihoods for our families and for the planet. We refuse to engage in deadlihoods and we engage in initiatives that support alivelihoods, regenerating ourselves, the earth’s natural systems and local healthy families and communities.

By participating in this journey, you support an effort to engage with equity and social and environmental justice, supporting localized circular economies, exploring more regenerative economic practices, helping a democratically run cooperative, and enhancing the practice of being a grateful guest of Earth.

## Faculty and team: 

**Guardianes de las Semillas** promotes native seeds and local knowledge about agroecological cycles and practices for food 
sovereignty in the peninsula of Yucatan. The collective is formed by Maya women and men that work in the milpa and that are 
commited to conserving the biocultural legacy of the milpa, basis of their diet and cosmovision.

**Haizel de la Cruz**, Born in Ticul and currently living in Buctzotz. A young photographer that documents the Mayan resistance
and the vitality of an ethics of care for life. A ceiba tree, that represents life, time, space and community for Mayan was the
first image that she captured with her cellphone. And her world moved.

![](/assets/img/courses/yucatan_fall/mon.jpeg){:.right.thumb width="250"}

**Mon Fernández** Mon is a young activist specialized in a politics of care for life. From that space she moves, accompanies 
and promotes the rights of women and disidences, the conservation of the jungle biodiversity and the processes of free 
education for children, among other threads that weave her lifepath.

**Pedro Uc Be** is a poet and a defender of the Mayan territory in Yucatan. Born in Buctzotz, he is the author of several books
and a recipient of different awards. For Pedro, poetry and the care for the land are the same, a deep root that is entangled to
his relationship to the milpa. His proposal is to share Mayan philosophy, thought and emotion a a proposal of life, of survival,
of joy and of health.

**Ana Marica**. Romanian community weaver, facilitator and learning designer exploring the rich tapestry of cultures around the world. On a mission to understand how communities can change for the better when self-directed learning principles are introduced in the educational process, she has spent the last 8 years researching and connecting with projects and communities from around the world who actively contribute to reimagining learning paradigms.
During this time, she has co-founded Digital Romads, a learning and organizational design consultancy whose purpose is to support communities and organizations explore transparent, open, self-managed, and co-created ways of collaborating and communicating. Currently based in Bucharest, Romania - her basecamp in between travels and explorations of various territories (both at surface and underwater)

![](/assets/img/courses/yucatan_fall/amaro.jpg){:.right.thumb width="250"}

**Gerardo Lopez-Amaro**. Co-founder of the Enlivened Cooperative, is currently walking  the path of autonomous education with the task of imagining spaces of encounter for thinking-feeling together about ways to strengthen the defense of life, memory and territory. He sees this as part of a planetary struggle for cognitive, relational and ontological justice. He is purposefully becoming entangled in a great “we” of people enacting the pluriverse, that “world where many worlds fit.” Born and raised in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, he’s a pilgrim of viable spaces informed by politics of love and consciousness regarding the healing of land and territory, love and intimacy, and labor and livelihood.
