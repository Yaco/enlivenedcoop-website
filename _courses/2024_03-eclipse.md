{:toc}

## Introduction

We invite you to journey and observe the total solar eclipse in Mazatlán, a beautiful beach city ideally located in the path of totality 
and with the best weather for astronomic events. We will create a contemplative space to reflect on alignment, disruption, pause and wonder, 
rhythms of enlightenment and endarkenment, as well as other insights and inspirations. In the previous week to the eclipse, we will be exploring
the South of the peninsula of Baja California, engaging with the diversity of marine ecosystems in the renowned ‘World’s Aquarium’, 
hiking through desert landscapes and attuning the ears, the heart and the mind to listen to the symphonies of the ocean composed by the whistles,
moans, chirps, cries, dances and themes of dolphins and whales. 

## Highlights

- Contemplative observation of the total solar eclipse in the best location in North America. This is a crafted time to let your mind wander 
into the spaciousness and insights of the sky in the eclipse.

- Engage with the diversity of marine life -dolphins, turtles, orcas, whales- in the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of California, 
supporting local companies and guided by experienced divers, enthusiasts of conservation.

- Learn about the marvelous complexity of cetaceans, their curiosity and playfulness, the beauty of the underwater soundscapes, the current challenges
they are facing and the lessons that can be listened to if the heart is open to approach them with respect. 

- Hike some of the amazing trails that Baja Sur offers, admiring a vast diversity of landscapes including rocky canyons, coastal sand dunes and scenic
deserts. 

- Enjoy one of the tastiest cuisines in the world, a result of the uniqueness and diversity of ecosystems in the peninsula. From fresh seafood to 
vegan options, the Baja Sur offers delicious options for everybody.


## What is an un/learning journey?

The raw material of an un/learning journey is time. With care, we curate, knead, craft and, sometimes, even co-create it. 

They are an interruption, a slowing down, many openings. 

They are brave passages to possibilities, invitations to go out of the familiar zone and expand our sensibilities to let ourselves be undone so that we can suspend the noise of the routine and be attuned to dreams, stories and practices that instigate a process of becoming guided by the calm whisper and the joyous dance of the Earth. 

Unlike tourism, this is not about consuming experiences, places, or people. 

It is about engaging with the land and her guardians (human, non-human, more-than-human). 

It is about activating the memory that walks to the encounter of what is different -tastes, landscapes, textures, languages, rhythms, ways of knowing, modes of being- with curiosity and respect. 

The journey is simultaneously a retreat, a ceremony and a ritual that embraces the unknown as a fertile soil for radicalizing imagination and a pathway to deepen the relations to self, life, consciousness and the many worlds that constitute the pluriverse. 

## Who is this for?

The journeys are for those willing to participate in the co-creation of different stories, dreams and practices, for those searching to expand their horizons and attune their sensibilities and desires, for those daring to entertain an open mind and heart, holding contradictions with authenticity and making space for questions rather than answers. They are for those willing to explore who they really are and how to become present for the Earth in a mutually enhancing way.

We strongly encourage to apply for the program to everyone who feels called to join, especially to people of all ages with a serious commitment to re-inventing their relationship to Earth and to self, activists, artists, scientists, students, unschoolers, therapists, educators, farmers, community organizers, magicians, dropouts, writers, workers, and everyone resonating with the invitation to be present with the other worlds that are possible and that are already here.

# Ecopedagogy and travelling

Before, during and after the journey we exercise a cosmopolitical pedagogy of emergence (COPE). We understand cosmopolitics as an exercise of ‘slowing down reasoning’ (Stengers) that creates an opening for possible articulations between worlds. In this sense, it is a pedagogy of encounter, of sourcing inner wisdom, of dialogue between cultures and world-making practices, one that involves movement, story, dreams, inquiries, solidarities, boundaries and practices that allow for the uniqueness of the process of coming into being, of a becoming that invites a new relationship of the human within an entangled, endangered yet potent web of life. 

Before the journey, registered participants will get access to a platform with resources on different topics of the journey, such as: Maya culture, the Chicxulub event, Deep Time perspective, anti-tourism and radical hospitality, marine life ecosystems, archeoastronomy and indigenous peoples resistance to extractivist models of development. These are materials and resources that learners can engage freely, at their own rhythm and with no expected outcome. Participants are invited to choose one topic of inquiry during their journey that is relevant and alive for them.

During the journey, we will have a combination of visits, group process sessions, lectures, practices and free time. Participants are invited to document their journey in the way that suits them better for their learning process.

## Cost

As a cooperative, we are trying new approaches to make the journeys affordable for as many people as possible while covering the costs and paying our faculty and hosts. We are experimenting with a sliding scale in which you can choose the fee according to your life situation. 

Consider contributing MORE on the scale if you:

- have the ability to comfortably meet all of your basic needs
- belong to a sponsoring organization or are employed full-time
- have investments, retirement accounts, or inherited money
- travel recreationally
- have access to family money and resources in times of need
- work part-time by choice
- own the home you live in
- have a relatively high degree of earning power due to level of education (or gender and racial privilege, class background, etc.)

Consider contributing LESS on the scale if you.

- have difficulty covering basic expenses
- are supporting children or have other dependents
- have significant debt
- have medical expenses not covered by insurance
- are an elder with limited financial support
- are an unpaid community organizer
- have unstable housing and/or limited access to reliable transportation
- have not taken a vacation or time off due to the financial burden

(This is based on the ‘Green Bottle’ sliding scale model by Alexis J. Cunningfolk | www.wortsandcunning.com)

If you select an amount at the higher end of the scale, you will make possible future offerings and support the good work of the speakers, facilitators, and organizers who are generously contributing their gifts to this event.

- Basic fee: $2,600 USD in shared accommodation and $2,900 in private accommodation. 
- Regular fee: $2,900 USD in shared accomodation and $3,200 in private accommodation.

## Ethics and economy

As a cooperative, we believe in offering programs that help you, your community and the world be enlivened again. We strive to co-create regenerative livelihoods for our families and for the planet. We refuse to engage in deadlihoods and we engage in initiatives that support alivelihoods, regenerating ourselves, the earth’s natural systems and local healthy families and communities.

By participating in this journey, you support an effort to engage with equity and social and environmental justice, supporting localized circular economies, exploring more regenerative economic practices, helping a democratically run cooperative, and enhancing the practice of being a grateful guest of Earth.

## Faculty and team: 

**David Giménez**, explorer and marine naturalist, psychologist, ethologist, freediver. Passionate of the ocean, professional diver, and activist for the care of marine ecosystems.

**Gerardo López-Amaro**, co-founder of the Enlivened Cooperative, is currently walking  the path of autonomous education with the task of imagining spaces of encounter for thinking-feeling together about ways to strengthen the defense of life, memory and territory. He sees this as part of a planetary struggle for cognitive, relational and ontological justice. He is purposefully becoming entangled in a great “we” of people enacting the pluriverse, that “world where many worlds fit.” Born and raised in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, he’s a pilgrim of viable spaces informed by politics of love and consciousness regarding the healing of land and territory, love and intimacy, and labor and livelihood.
