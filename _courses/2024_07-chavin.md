# A pilgrimage of becoming in the Andes: the walking memory of Buen Vivir and mutual upbringing.

{:toc}

## Introduction

This is a call to participate on a pilgrimage of deepening and encounter in the central Andes of Peru, where the ancestral ceremonial center of Chavin de Huantar is located. 
Chavin (chawpin: ‘the center’) has been a point of encounter (‘tinkuy’) since 3000 years ago, where people from different places and paths would prepare and walk to reach this space of initiation, un/learning, exchange and transformation. The temple and its fascinating architecture is designed as a labyrinth palace dedicated to memory and interconnection of life forms and beings. 
This year, 2024, we will be re-activating the walking memory of this path, accompanied by the hirkakuna (guardian mountains), making offerings to the wankakuna (memory monoliths) and the vital bodies of water: rahukuna (‘snow capped mountains), mayukuna (rivers), quchakuna (lagoons) and to the tamya (rain). 
We will be weaving our force and breath, walking on the footsteps of the ancestors of inner visions dedicated to take care of life in the Andean-Amazonian ethical principle of ‘raise and be raised by’, conducting our bodies and essences in a naani (path) composed by infinite arrivals and departures, connecting to a deep, teluric and cosmic mystery.
This is an invitation to be present in an initiatic journey to meet the tsatsakuna (‘elders’) that dwell in the most intimate of our blood and bones, recognizing ourselves as part of one community of humans and non-humans, holding the responsibility, joy and wisdom of Buen Vivir, impregnated by the colors, textures and smells of the lands where we come from and those where we dwell. 


## Highlights

- Contemplative hike (pilgrimage) in the Central Andes of Peru, from Huaraz to the ancient temple of Chavin de Huantar. This
  includes visits and offerings to stunning lagoons, sacred caves and passes across the renowned Coordillera Blanca.

- Engage with the Andean wisdom of local communities that are cultivating ways of being rooted in a cosmovision of mutual upbringin,
  'raising and being raised by' the intimate conversation of life.

- Dive into your inner landscape and a journey of self-inquiry in a ceremony with the sacred plant of wachuma. 

- Be nourished by seasonal, local, natural and revitalizing food and participate in a profoundly transformative embodied practices. 


## What is an un/learning journey?

The raw material of an un/learning journey is time. With care, we curate, knead, craft and, sometimes, even co-create it. 

They are an interruption, a slowing down, many openings. 

They are brave passages to possibilities, invitations to go out of the familiar zone and expand our sensibilities to let ourselves be undone so that we can suspend the noise of the routine and be attuned to dreams, stories and practices that instigate a process of becoming guided by the calm whisper and the joyous dance of the Earth. 

Unlike tourism, this is not about consuming experiences, places, or people. 

It is about engaging with the land and her guardians (human, non-human, more-than-human). 

It is about activating the memory that walks to the encounter of what is different -tastes, landscapes, textures, languages, rhythms, ways of knowing, modes of being- with curiosity and respect. 

The journey is simultaneously a retreat, a ceremony and a ritual that embraces the unknown as a fertile soil for radicalizing imagination and a pathway to deepen the relations to self, life, consciousness and the many worlds that constitute the pluriverse. 

## Who is this for?

The journeys are for those willing to participate in the co-creation of different stories, dreams and practices, for those searching to expand their horizons and attune their sensibilities and desires, for those daring to entertain an open mind and heart, holding contradictions with authenticity and making space for questions rather than answers. They are for those willing to explore who they really are and how to become present for the Earth in a mutually enhancing way.

We strongly encourage to apply for the program to everyone who feels called to join, especially to people of all ages with a serious commitment to re-inventing their relationship to Earth and to self, activists, artists, scientists, students, unschoolers, therapists, educators, farmers, community organizers, magicians, dropouts, writers, workers, and everyone resonating with the invitation to be present with the other worlds that are possible and that are already here.

# Ecopedagogy and travelling

Before, during and after the journey we exercise a cosmopolitical pedagogy of emergence (COPE). We understand cosmopolitics as an exercise of ‘slowing down reasoning’ (Stengers) that creates an opening for possible articulations between worlds. In this sense, it is a pedagogy of encounter, of sourcing inner wisdom, of dialogue between cultures and world-making practices, one that involves movement, story, dreams, inquiries, solidarities, boundaries and practices that allow for the uniqueness of the process of coming into being, of a becoming that invites a new relationship of the human within an entangled, endangered yet potent web of life. 

Participants are invited to choose one topic of inquiry during their journey that is relevant and alive for them.

During the journey, we will have a combination of visits, group process sessions, lectures, practices and free time. Participants are invited to document their journey in the way that suits them better for their learning process.

## GENERAL REQUIREMENTS TO PARTICIPATE


- Sufficient physical conditioning to hike in the mountains, from 3000 to 4700 meters above sea level.

- Must fill out the registration form and participate in a virtual interview.

## LANGUAGES

We will be using Quechua, Spanish, English and Portuguese throughout our journey. Translation into these languages will be offered by the team. 


## Cost

As a cooperative, we are trying new approaches to make the journeys affordable for as many people as possible while covering the costs and paying our faculty and hosts. We are experimenting with a sliding scale in which you can choose the fee according to your life situation.

- have significant debt
- have medical expenses not covered by insurance

(This is based on the ‘Green Bottle’ sliding scale model by Alexis J. Cunningfolk | www.wortsandcunning.com)

She is a hiker and a contemporary guardian of the temple and of the traditional and ancestral knowledge of this part of the Andes.
