# Huasteca journey: embroidery, wise food and celebration of the dead

1. this ordered seed list will be replaced by the toc
{:toc}

## Introduction

The Huasteca is a bioregion of enormous socioecological diversity and significance, home to the Teenek, Nahuat and Xi’oi cultures, nations that have dwelled in the rain forests, waterfalls, caves, mountains and valleys that configure its rich topography. Ancient cities like Tamtok are proof of the complex urbanization systems and the observation of astronomical cycles. The rich oral history and the colorful weaving and embroidery tell the stories of the time before time and the vibrancy of celebrations and rituals announce a respectful way of being in relationship with the land and her sentient beings.
Xantolo is a month-long series of celebrations leading to the Day of the Dead. Dances, food, songs, conversations, art and food are shared throughout this vast region that comprises seven different states. Ancestors are an essential part of the community of life and in this particular period of the year life and death are celebrated as an integral part of one cycle of renewal and disruption, of grief and celebration, of mystery and change.
In this unique  journey we will have the opportunity to engage with local communities involved in the co-creation of initiatives related to agroecology, food sovereignty, art, solidarity economy and activism. We will have the extraordinary opportunity of being hosted mainly by a network of indigenous women that has been active for the past decade in the region.

## What is an un/learning journey?

The raw material of an un/learning journey is time. With care, we curate, knead, craft and, sometimes, even co-create it. 

They are an interruption, a slowing down, many openings. 

They are brave passages to possibilities, invitations to go out of the familiar zone and expand our sensibilities to let ourselves be undone so that we can suspend the noise of the routine and be attuned to dreams, stories and practices that instigate a process of becoming guided by the calm whisper and the joyous dance of the Earth. 

Unlike tourism, this is not about consuming experiences, places, or people. 

It is about engaging with the land and her guardians (human, non-human, more-than-human). 

It is about activating the memory that walks to the encounter of what is different -tastes, landscapes, textures, languages, rhythms, ways of knowing, modes of being- with curiosity and respect. 

The journey is simultaneously a retreat, a ceremony and a ritual that embraces the unknown as a fertile soil for radicalizing imagination and a pathway to deepen the relations to self, life, consciousness and the many worlds that constitute the pluriverse. 

## Who is this for?

The journeys are for those willing to participate in the co-creation of different stories, dreams and practices, for those searching to expand their horizons and attune their sensibilities and desires, for those daring to entertain an open mind and heart, holding contradictions with authenticity and making space for questions rather than answers. They are for those willing to explore who they really are and how to become present for the Earth in a mutually enhancing way.

We strongly encourage to apply for the program to everyone who feels called to join, especially to people of all ages with a serious commitment to re-inventing their relationship to Earth and to self, activists, artists, scientists, students, unschoolers, therapists, educators, farmers, community organizers, magicians, dropouts, writers, workers, and everyone resonating with the invitation to be present with the other worlds that are possible and that are already here.

## Ecopedagogy and travelling

Before, during and after the journey we exercise a cosmopolitical pedagogy of emergence (COPE). We understand cosmopolitics as an exercise of ‘slowing down reasoning’ (Stengers) that creates an opening for possible articulations between worlds. In this sense, it is a pedagogy of encounter, of sourcing inner wisdom, of dialogue between cultures and world-making practices, one that involves movement, story, dreams, inquiries, solidarities, boundaries and practices that allow for the uniqueness of the process of coming into being, of a becoming that invites a new relationship of the human within an entangled, endangered yet potent web of life. 

Before the journey, registered participants will get access to a platform with resources on different topics of the journey, such as: Maya culture, the Chicxulub event, Deep Time perspective, anti-tourism and radical hospitality, marine life ecosystems, archeoastronomy and indigenous peoples resistance to extractivist models of development. These are materials and resources that learners can engage freely, at their own rhythm and with no expected outcome. Participants are invited to choose one topic of inquiry during their journey that is relevant and alive for them.

During the journey, we will have a combination of visits, group process sessions, lectures, practices and free time. Participants are invited to document their journey in the way that suits them better for their learning process.

## Cost

As a cooperative, we are trying new approaches to make the journeys affordable for as many people as possible while covering the costs and paying our faculty and hosts. We are experimenting with a sliding scale in which you can choose the fee according to your life situation. 

Consider contributing MORE on the scale if you:

- have the ability to comfortably meet all of your basic needs
- belong to a sponsoring organization or are employed full-time

- travel recreationally
- have access to family money and resources in times of need
- work part-time by choice
- own the home you live in

Consider contributing LESS on the scale if you.

- are supporting children or have other dependents
- have significant debt
- have medical expenses not covered by insurance
- are an elder with limited financial support
- are an unpaid community organizer
- have unstable housing and/or limited access to reliable transportation
- have not taken a vacation or time off due to the financial burden

(This is based on the ‘Green Bottle’ sliding scale model by Alexis J. Cunningfolk | www.wortsandcunning.com)

If you select an amount at the higher end of the scale, you will make possible future offerings and support the good work of the speakers, facilitators, and organizers who are generously contributing their gifts to this event.

## Ethics and economy

As a cooperative, we believe in offering programs that help you, your community and the world be enlivened again. We strive to co-create regenerative livelihoods for our families and for the planet. We refuse to engage in deadlihoods and we engage in initiatives that support alivelihoods, regenerating ourselves, the earth’s natural systems and local healthy families and communities.

We adopt the three principles of permaculture: Care for the Earth, Care for the People and Fair Share. We embrace the idea of surplus being shared with everyone involved in making the journey possible. We assign 40% of the profits of the journey to the cooperative, 10% for a local project aligned with this vision, and 50% to be proportionally divided between the team that carried out the project. By participating in this journey, you support an effort to engage with equity and social and environmental justice, supporting localized circular economies, exploring more regenerative economic practices, helping a democratically run cooperative, and enhancing the practice of being a grateful guest of Earth.
