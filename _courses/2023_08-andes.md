# Peru journey: Andean and Amazonian knots of remembrance and mutual upbringing

1. this ordered seed list will be replaced by the toc
{:toc}

## Introduction

The Andes Mountains, created over 50 million years ago,  is a collection of various mountain chains interwoven in orographic knots, running for 7,200 kilometres (4,500 miles). The Peruvian Tropical Andes are home to more than 45,000 plants and 3,000 vertebrate species, half of them endemic. They also house 99% of all tropical glaciers in the world. Its lagoons and lakes -guarded by frailejones, gigantic silver-leafed plants specialized in collecting water from the clouds and siphoning it into the ground- are the source of astounding rivers such as the Orinoco and the Amazon.

The highlands remember the cosmic travel of the serpent-river, the Wilkamayu, bridging heavens and earth.  The deep memory of time is harbored by the stories, literally woven in knots of remembrance of quipus (an Andean device for recording information, consisting of variously colored threads knotted in different ways), roads, cities, temples, observatories, as well as rocks, seeds, and textiles.

The Andean and Amazonian ‘world’ is appreciated by the runa (indigenous people) like a person, composed of forms of life harmoniously sheltered in a conversation to recreate life. It is a world of mutual upbringing: “the same way we raise the alpacas, they raise us”. Reciprocity is the pleasure of give and raise with affection, engaging in complex, stained conversations that sustain creative tensions.

These worlds are facing very complex challenges.  On average, the glaciers in the Andean region – Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru – have lost over 50 per cent of their coverage since the 1960s. Amazonian forest fires impact directly in the thinning and melting of glaciers in the Andes. Agriculture at the highest altitudes in the world is acutely threatened by the climate emergency with increasingly extreme droughts, hailstorms and frosts. The Andes hold the world’s largest mineral deposits of gold, copper, silver, lithium and molybdenum.

This is an invitation to tie ourselves in knots, with the mountains, with the stories, with the Andean and Amazonian worlds of mutual upbringing. It is an invitation to follow on the trail of the cosmic serpent in the sacred river.

## What is an un/learning journey?

The raw material of an un/learning journey is time. With care, we curate, knead, craft and, sometimes, even co-create it. 

They are an interruption, a slowing down, many openings. 

They are brave passages to possibilities, invitations to go out of the familiar zone and expand our sensibilities to let ourselves be undone so that we can suspend the noise of the routine and be attuned to dreams, stories and practices that instigate a process of becoming guided by the calm whisper and the joyous dance of the Earth. 

Unlike tourism, this is not about consuming experiences, places, or people. 

It is about engaging with the land and her guardians (human, non-human, more-than-human). 

It is about activating the memory that walks to the encounter of what is different -tastes, landscapes, textures, languages, rhythms, ways of knowing, modes of being- with curiosity and respect. 

The journey is simultaneously a retreat, a ceremony and a ritual that embraces the unknown as a fertile soil for radicalizing imagination and a pathway to deepen the relations to self, life, consciousness and the many worlds that constitute the pluriverse. 

## Who is this for?

The journeys are for those willing to participate in the co-creation of different stories, dreams and practices, for those searching to expand their horizons and attune their sensibilities and desires, for those daring to entertain an open mind and heart, holding contradictions with authenticity and making space for questions rather than answers. They are for those willing to explore who they really are and how to become present for the Earth in a mutually enhancing way.

We strongly encourage to apply for the program to everyone who feels called to join, especially to people of all ages with a serious commitment to re-inventing their relationship to Earth and to self, activists, artists, scientists, students, unschoolers, therapists, educators, farmers, community organizers, magicians, dropouts, writers, workers, and everyone resonating with the invitation to be present with the other worlds that are possible and that are already here.

We will stay for the night in Sicuani.

### Day 5. Wednesday, August 30. Cusco

![](/assets/img/courses/andes/day-5.jpg)

We will drive back to Cusco, the “navel of the world”, former capital city of the Incas. This complex city integrates beautiful, contrasting architecture and fantastic shopping for local handicraft and textiles. We will have free time to wander around the streets of Cusco, where we will spend the night.

#### Day 6. Thursday, Aug 31. Inca Trail (Cusco - km 82 - Llactapata - Wayllabamba)/ Or Sacred Valley of the Incas

![](/assets/img/courses/andes/day-6.jpg)

The following 3 days travelers have two options: hiking the Inca Trail or visiting the Sacred Valley of the Incas. At the fourth day the group will meet again in Machu Picchu. 

If doing the Inca Trail, we will start at km. 82. We’ll start the trail by hiking along the banks of the Wilkamayu River, also known as Vilcanota, passing by small local villages and ruins sites scattered along the length of the valley until we arrive at our first major archaeological site, Llactapata, an important Inca settlement with still-intact constructions. Afterwards, we’ll hike to our lunch spot to recover our energy. After a fortifying lunch, we’ll continue up the Wayllabamba Valley surrounded by the local flora and walking in a cool, pleasant climate until we reach our first campsite at the village of Wayllabamba (2950m – 9678feet).

If doing the Sacred Valley of the Incas, we will drive for 2 hours to reach Chinchero, the center of weaving in Peru and home to the Interpretation Center of Andean Textiles, where we will meet with a women-led local cooperative of weavers with whom we will learn about this art and listen to the threaded stories of this ancient language. We will later drive to Urubabamba, where we will reach Kawsay T'ika, our hosting space for the following days.


### Day 7. Friday, Sep 1. Inca Trail (Wayllabamba - Warmiwañusca - Pacaymayu)

![](/assets/img/courses/andes/day-7.jpg)

Inca Trail: We’ll wake up to the singing celebration of birds and the whisper of the river. After breakfast, we will beginour hike to the highest point of the journey, Warmiwañuska Pass (4,215m – 13828Feet). This section will be a personal challenge for each hiker, but reaching the top is well worth the effort. If we are lucky, we’ll see condors circling above this pass, the ancient birds, guardians of the Peruvian Andes. Getting up to Warmiwañuska is an accomplishment that you will never forget.

We gently descend from there to our campsite in the Pacaymayu Ravine. At dinner we’ll share stories, resting in the embrace of the starry night sky and the surrounding mountains. 

Sacred Valley: we will drive to Moray, the experimental agroecological site of the Incas. The design of the site creates different conditions at each level of the terraces, causing a difference of temperature of 15 degrees Celsius (27 degrees Fahrenheit) between the higher and the lower levels. The different microclimates were used as a research agricultural station. Samples of soils from different regions have been found, suggesting they were specifically brought to the Sacred Valley. In the evening, we will return to Kaysay T'ika for our small group plenary.


### Day 8. Saturday, Sep 2. Inca Trail (Pacaymayu - Wiñay Wayna) / Rest and regeneration at Kawsay T'ika

![](/assets/img/courses/andes/day-8.jpg)

Inca Trail: this is a long day where we will appreciate different forms of beauty, from archaeological centers, intact Inca trail, tunnels, a wide diversity of microclimates, inter-Andean valleys, and cloud forest full of birds and hundreds of kinds of orchids.

After breakfast, we’ll gradually climb up to Runkuracay, an archaeological site half way up the mountain with a strategic view towards the valley. After our visit here, we’ll finish the last climb to the second highest pass on the trail, the Runkuracay Pass (3,800m – 12467feet), where we’ll see how the cloud forest spreads like a green blanket between the valleys. From the pass, we’ll descend towards the valley until we arrive at the next archaeological site of Sayacmarca (3,600m – 11811feet), known as “The Dominant Town” due to its commanding position above the surrounding valleys. We continue descending to our lunch spot at Chakicocha, and afterwards hike through unimaginable scenery, with countless orchid species, tunnels and foundations as deep as 10 meters. This splendid trail takes us over the third pass of the route and down to the archaeological site of Phuyupatamarca (3,665m – 12024feet), from where you’ll see Machu Picchu Mountain and the Vilcanota River, valley and glaciated mountain range.  If the weather cooperates, we’ll also see Salkantay (6,274m -20583 feet), the Apu of the region.

The trail zigzags down many staircases from Phuyupatamarca through thick vegetation towards Intipata and Wiñaywayna (2,650m – 8694 feet), two Inca sites near Machu Picchu with their own impressive architecture. We’ll spend our last night of camping in the pleasant, humid climate of Wiñaywayna. This is also our last night with the cooks and porters.

Sacred Valley: we will spend our day with free time to create convivial spaces, cooking together and learning about local food, meditating or engaging with the local community. This is an emergent, open space for the group to prepare for the visit to Machu Picchu the next day. 

### Day 9. Sunday, Sep 3. Inca Trail (Wiñay Wayna - Inti Punku - Machu Picchu - Huayna Picchu - Aguas Calientes - Cusco)

![](/assets/img/courses/andes/day-9.jpg)

Inca Trail: after breakfast, we hike to our first goal, the famous Intipunku (Sun Gate) at the entrance to Machu Picchu. The gate perfectly frames the majestic Inca city of Machu Picchu and affords excellent views of the valleys, rivers and sacred mountains that surround it. 

After taking in the splendid views we’ll descend along the trail into Machu Picchu itself, where we will have a tour inside the citadel, and where we will meet the other part of the group. After spending time on our own in the citadel, we will gather in Aguas Calientes, where we will take the train back to Cusco. 

Sacred Valley: we will drive to Ollantaytambo, where we will take the train to Aguas Calientes, where we will board the bus that takes us to the entrance of Machu Picchu. We will then do a tour of the citadel and will meet the other part of the group. fter spending time on our own in the citadel, we will gather in Aguas Calientes, where we will take the train back to Cusco. 

As an option for both groups, we can do the hike to the top of Wayna Picchu, the highest surrounding peak and site of sacred temples. 

### Day 10. Monday, Sep 4. Cusco - Tarapoto - Lamas

![](/assets/img/courses/andes/day-10.png)

We will take a short domestic flight between Cusco and Tarapoto and then drive for 25 km to the neighboring town of Lamas.

### Day 11. Tuesday, Sep 5. Lamas

![](/assets/img/courses/andes/day-11.png)


We will have a day off with possibility to go to the thermal waters and waterfalls in the area.

### Day 12. Wednesday, Sep 6. Lamas

![](/assets/img/courses/andes/day-12.jpg)

We will meet with the former members of Waman Wasi, a cultural center dedicated for 17 years to the cultural affirmation, with emphasis on agrobiodiversity, health and intercultural education. 

### Day 13. Thursday, Sep 7. Integration/Celebration

![](/assets/img/courses/andes/day-13.jpg)

This day will be dedicated to sharing reflections and questions raised during the journey and in the evening, we will host an integration session, a closing ceremony and a party.

### Day 14. Friday, Sep 8. Departures

We will take a short domestic flight to Lima, where we will end our journey.

# Ecopedagogy and travelling

Before, during and after the journey we exercise a cosmopolitical pedagogy of emergence (COPE). We understand cosmopolitics as an exercise of ‘slowing down reasoning’ (Stengers) that creates an opening for possible articulations between worlds. In this sense, it is a pedagogy of encounter, of sourcing inner wisdom, of dialogue between cultures and world-making practices, one that involves movement, story, dreams, inquiries, solidarities, boundaries and practices that allow for the uniqueness of the process of coming into being, of a becoming that invites a new relationship of the human within an entangled, endangered yet potent web of life. 

Before the journey, registered participants will get access to a platform with resources on different topics of the journey, such as: Maya culture, the Chicxulub event, Deep Time perspective, anti-tourism and radical hospitality, marine life ecosystems, archeoastronomy and indigenous peoples resistance to extractivist models of development. These are materials and resources that learners can engage freely, at their own rhythm and with no expected outcome. Participants are invited to choose one topic of inquiry during their journey that is relevant and alive for them.

During the journey, we will have a combination of visits, group process sessions, lectures, practices and free time. Participants are invited to document their journey in the way that suits them better for their learning process.

## Cost

As a cooperative, we are trying new approaches to make the journeys affordable for as many people as possible while covering the costs and paying our faculty and hosts. We are experimenting with a sliding scale in which you can choose the fee according to your life situation. 

Consider contributing MORE on the scale if you:

## A note about the Wilkamayu, the sacred river below and above

From the southern part of the planet there is a sky that cannot be seen from the north, and vice versa. Some say that the time has come for the peoples of the earth to focus for a moment on learning to look from the south. Perhaps this change of perspective serves to recompose the path of a humanity that has lost its north.

They tell that the history of human encounters consists of embraces and crossings. In that walk, the earth was populated with different languages, colors, songs, prayers and dances, each one inheriting their own way of weaving into the other.

But movement and life is older than that history. At the point where earth and sky almost seem to touch each other, there are ancestral beings that still remember the early times. There, in the Andes, are those who did not forget to read the sky and its nocturnal chiaroscuros. It is known that life below is a reflection of life above, and vice versa. To the attentive eye the darkness reveals the life that congregates around the mayu, the sacred river: llamas and their young, shepherds, toads, foxes, partridges and snakes form their ayllu, their community of life.

Today's pastors remember the serpent's journey. One day, as a crosser of multiple worlds, the serpent came down to earth captivated by the world that was hinted here. They say that the entrance was so grand that the great lagoon that received the unusual celestial descent overflowed and flowed down the mountain, creating a sacred river that would eventually feed the land and its people for generations. That river became more and more wide, river and snake together in loving expansion, until it found the infinite water of the sea. Satisfied, the serpent climbed back to her ayllu to communicate what she had seen. Satisfied, the serpent stayed forever flourishing with the beings that gathered around her.

It is said that such are the origins of the rivers now known as Wikamayu (Urubamba) and Amazonas.

Immemorial moons have passed since those first trips. Around the great water snake, unparalleled biological diversity was generated, and successive peoples flourished in the same way that potatoes and corn flourished. The apus, unfading guardians, have been privy to the movement of time and its tribulations. Never, however, had they seen one of the earth’s creatures work so actively towards their own extinction. “Little by little they are extinguished, extinguishing,” they say with sorrow in the heart.

There are already many centuries of wars of different kinds that have led to contemporary calamities: global warming, proliferation of consumerism, loss of mother tongue and ayllu, monetarization of the economy, food shortages, pollution, the severing from the sense of sacred, poverty and repression towards the defenders of Mother Earth, are just some of the phenomena that threaten life in the Andes and on the planet.

Before this, the necessary evocation arises for human beings to enchant themselves with the life that they are and of which they form a part of; to cultivate humility and an open heart toward daily sacredness; to cultivate love for the one who came and for those to come; to observe with attention and without fear the fertile darkness that manifests its secrets, and to enable once again the encounter between embraces and crossings.
