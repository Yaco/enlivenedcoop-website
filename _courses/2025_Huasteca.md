# Borderlands: Celebrating Life and Honoring the Dead in Huasteca, Mexico

1. this ordered seed list will be replaced by the toc
{:toc}

## The invitation

In the geographic center of Mexico there is an area where diverse realities converge, showcasing the richness of borders and margins—spaces brimming with creativity, portals to other landscapes, realities, and forms of consciousness. At this intersection, bridges are built, perspectives shift, transitions are experienced, rigid predefinitions of reality are questioned, and one steps into an active world in the process of becoming. This journey is a pilgrimage to that membrane of the borderlands.

This two-week pilgrimage takes us to inhabit several of these edges, moving between the mystical desert of Wirikuta and the humid mystery of the cloud forest, being reborn in the swollen belly of the temazcal and in sacred caves—the very entrails of Mother Earth. We will reinvigorate the body with ritual fasting and celebrate the abundance of the harvest in family and community banquets. We will weave the cosmos with the ethereal dance of the hawk or renew our pact with life in communion with the master plant of the desert. We will move through the solemnity of mourning, and the colorful joy of cemeteries and homes as we celebrate the return of our loved ones during the Day of the Dead.

On this pilgrimage, we will be welcomed by indigenous Wixárika, Téenek, and Náhuatl teachers, as well as local leaders engaged in processes of memory, identity affirmation, food sovereignty, and biological and cultural diversity. Ancient cities like Tamtok are proof of the complex urbanization systems and the observation of astronomical cycles. The rich oral history and the colorful weaving and embroidery tell the stories of the time before time and the vibrancy of celebrations and rituals announce a respectful way of being in relationship with the land and her sentient beings.

The host team will accompany the integration of the journey through external and internal landscapes, guiding us in a co-creative process of dialogue, word circles, somatic practices, games, meditations, collective altar building, and music.


## What is an un/learning journey?

The raw material of an un/learning journey is time. With care, we curate, knead, craft and co-create it. 

This is a transformative experience focused on attuning the senses to possibilities and engaging deeply with new perspectives. It invites participants to release assumptions, connect with the land and her guardians and activate the memory that walks to the encounter of what is different (tastes, landscapes, textures, languages, rhythms, ways of knowing, modes of being) through curiosity and respect. It is an invitation to immerse oneself in a shared process of becoming—nurturing imagination, self-awareness, and meaningful connections with the world. 

## Who is this for?

![](/assets/img/courses/huaesteca/Huasteca_group_walking1.jpg){:.right.thumb width="270"}

The journeys are for those willing to participate in the co-creation of different stories, dreams and practices, for those searching to expand their horizons and attune their sensibilities and desires, for those daring to entertain an open mind and heart, holding contradictions with authenticity and making space for questions rather than answers. They are for those willing to explore who they really are and how to become present for the Earth in a mutually enhancing way.

We strongly encourage to apply for the program to everyone who feels called to join, especially to people of all ages with a serious commitment to re-inventing their relationship to Earth and to self, activists, artists, scientists, students, unschoolers, therapists, educators, farmers, community organizers, magicians, dropouts, writers, workers, and everyone resonating with the invitation to be present with the other worlds that are possible and that are already here. 


## Itinerary

Dates: October 23rd-November 4th, 2025

#### Thursday, October 23: Crossing the Threshold

Meeting in the city of San Luis Potosí by noon, we leave behind the familiar and journey into the Wirikuta desert, a sacred land where life and death intertwine in the eternal dance of creation.

#### Friday, October 24: Planting Dreams in the Desert

In the quiet embrace of Carretas, we open our circle, a space to honor the journey ahead. Through ceremony and intention, we plant the seeds of re-imagination, inviting the desert to guide us.

#### Saturday, October 25: Where the Sky Meets the Land

We make our way to Real de Catorce, where we walk in pilgrimage to Cerro del Quemado, a sacred mountain whispered to be the heart of Wirikuta. Here, in ceremony, the mountain listens as we offer our prayers, our questions, and our quiet resolve. 

#### Sunday, October 26: The Path of Renewal

In the morning, through the heat of a temazcal ceremony, we cleanse our bodies and spirits, renewing layers. In the afternoon we make our way from the desert’s expanse to the lush embrace of the Huasteca jungle, which will be our host for the rest of our journey. 

#### Monday, October 27: Roots of Wisdom

A day of stillness and rest by the river. In the afternoon, we meet an elder holding the deep wisdom of the Teenek people. His stories, like ancient roots, offer insights into the connection between life, land, and spirit, grounding us in the heart of this journey. 

#### Tuesday, October 28: Flowing into Wonder

![](/assets/img/courses/huaesteca/Danza-gavilan.png){:.left.thumb width="250"} 

In Tamaleton, we witness the Danza del Gavilan, a ritual that speaks of survival, strength, and balance. Conversations with the dancers and weavers deepen our understanding before we end the day at the Sotano de las Golondrinas, watching swallows circle in the twilight.

Driving to Matlapa, we arrive in time for the cambio de fiscal in Axtla, a ritual marking the passing of responsibility from one community leader, or fiscal, to another — a sacred act rooted in continuity and collective care. The air is alive with celebration and reverence, a vivid tapestry of tradition that bridges generations. 

#### Saturday, November 1: Faces of the Spirit

![](/assets/img/courses/huaesteca/Huasteca-masks.jpg){:.left.thumb width="250"} 

In Chapulhuacanito, we meet an artist who crafts the faces of the unseen. As evening falls, we return to create our altar, a space to honor those who have passed and those who remain.

#### Sunday, November 2: The Veil’s Lifting

On the Day of the Dead, we step into a world where the living and the departed meet. Through group process and shared reflection, we honor this sacred communion and the stories it reveals.

#### Tuesday, November 4: Carrying the journey home

As we part ways from Matlapa, the land’s wisdom stays with us—a quiet voice urging us to walk gently, to live deeply, and to hold life and death as one.


## Ecopedagogy and travelling

Before, during and after the journey we exercise a cosmopolitical pedagogy of emergence (COPE). We understand cosmopolitics as an exercise of ‘slowing down reasoning’ (Stengers) that creates an opening for possible articulations between worlds. In this sense, it is a pedagogy of encounter, of sourcing inner wisdom, of dialogue between cultures and world-making practices, one that involves movement, story, dreams, inquiries, solidarities, boundaries and practices that allow for the uniqueness of the process of coming into being, of a becoming that invites a new relationship of the human within an entangled, endangered yet potent web of life. 

During the journey, we will have a combination of visits, group process sessions, lectures, practices and free time. Participants are invited to document their journey in the way that suits them better for their learning process.


## Cost

As a cooperative, we are exploring new approaches to make the journeys accessible for as many people as possible while covering the logistical costs involved and honouring the contributions of our faculty, the projects hosting us and the team. 
To support this, we have adopted a sliding scale model - inviting you to choose a fee that reflects your life possibilities. 

**The suggested contribution for this yatra is based on a sliding scale from USD 2000 to USD 3000.**

Consider contributing MORE on the scale if you:

- have the ability to comfortably meet all of your basic needs
- belong to a sponsoring organization or are employed full-time
- have investments, retirement accounts, or inherited money
- travel recreationally
- have access to family money and resources in times of need
- work part-time by choice
- own the home you live in
- have a relatively high degree of earning power due to level of education (or gender and racial privilege, class background, etc.)

Consider contributing LESS on the scale if you.

- have difficulty covering basic expenses
- are supporting children or have other dependents
- have significant debt
- have medical expenses not covered by insurance
- are an elder with limited financial support
- are an unpaid community organizer
- have unstable housing and/or limited access to reliable transportation
- have not taken a vacation or time off due to the financial burden

((This model is inspired by our friends at Re-imagine Education and is based on the ‘Green Bottle’ sliding scale model by Alexis J. Cunningfolk | www.wortsandcunning.com)

If you select an amount at the higher end of the scale, you will make possible future offerings and support the good work of the speakers, facilitators, and organizers who are generously contributing their gifts to this event. You will also be contributing to the partial grants fund for those needing financial support.

We require a non-refundable deposit of $500 USD to book your spot.

## Ethics and economy

As a cooperative, we believe in offering programs that help you, your community and the world be enlivened again. We strive to co-create regenerative livelihoods for our families and for the planet. We refuse to engage in deadlihoods and we engage in initiatives that support alivelihoods, regenerating ourselves, the earth’s natural systems and local healthy families and communities.

We adopt the three principles of permaculture: Care for the Earth, Care for the People and Fair Share. We embrace the idea of surplus being shared with everyone involved in making the journey possible.

![](/assets/img/courses/huaesteca/gerardo.jpg){:.right.thumb width="250"}

**Gerardo López-Amaro**, co-founder of the Enlivened Cooperative, is currently walking  the path of autonomous education with the task of imagining spaces of encounter for thinking-feeling together about ways to strengthen the defense of life, memory and territory. He sees this as part of a planetary struggle for cognitive, relational and ontological justice. He is purposefully becoming entangled in a great “we” of people enacting the pluriverse, that “world where many worlds fit.” Born and raised in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, he’s a pilgrim of viable spaces informed by politics of love and consciousness regarding the healing of land and territory, love and intimacy, and labor and livelihood.
