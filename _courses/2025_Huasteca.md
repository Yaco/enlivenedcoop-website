# Borderlands: Celebrating Life and Honoring the Dead in Huasteca, Mexico

1. this ordered seed list will be replaced by the toc
{:toc}

## The invitation

In the geographic center of Mexico there is an area where diverse realities converge, showcasing the richness of borders and margins—spaces brimming with creativity, portals to other landscapes, realities, and forms of consciousness. At this intersection, bridges are built, perspectives shift, transitions are experienced, rigid predefinitions of reality are questioned, and one steps into an active world in the process of becoming. This journey is a pilgrimage to that membrane of the borderlands.

This two-week pilgrimage takes us to inhabit several of these edges, moving between the mystical desert of Wirikuta and the humid mystery of the cloud forest, being reborn in the swollen belly of the temazcal and in sacred caves—the very entrails of Mother Earth. We will reinvigorate the body with ritual fasting and celebrate the abundance of the harvest in family and community banquets. We will weave the cosmos with the ethereal dance of the hawk or renew our pact with life in communion with the master plant of the desert. We will move through the solemnity of mourning, and the colorful joy of cemeteries and homes as we celebrate the return of our loved ones during the Day of the Dead.

On this pilgrimage, we will be welcomed by indigenous Wixárika, Téenek, and Náhuatl teachers, as well as local leaders engaged in processes of memory, identity affirmation, food sovereignty, and biological and cultural diversity. Ancient cities like Tamtok are proof of the complex urbanization systems and the observation of astronomical cycles. The rich oral history and the colorful weaving and embroidery tell the stories of the time before time and the vibrancy of celebrations and rituals announce a respectful way of being in relationship with the land and her sentient beings.

The host team will accompany the integration of the journey through external and internal landscapes, guiding us in a co-creative process of dialogue, word circles, somatic practices, games, meditations, collective altar building, and music.


## What is an un/learning journey?

The raw material of an un/learning journey is time. With care, we curate, knead, craft and co-create it. 

This is a transformative experience focused on attuning the senses to possibilities and engaging deeply with new perspectives. It invites participants to release assumptions, connect with the land and her guardians and activate the memory that walks to the encounter of what is different (tastes, landscapes, textures, languages, rhythms, ways of knowing, modes of being) through curiosity and respect. It is an invitation to immerse oneself in a shared process of becoming—nurturing imagination, self-awareness, and meaningful connections with the world. 

## Who is this for?

![](/assets/img/courses/huaesteca/Huasteca_group_walking1.jpg){:.right.thumb width="250"}

The journeys are for those willing to participate in the co-creation of different stories, dreams and practices, for those searching to expand their horizons and attune their sensibilities and desires, for those daring to entertain an open mind and heart, holding contradictions with authenticity and making space for questions rather than answers. They are for those willing to explore who they really are and how to become present for the Earth in a mutually enhancing way.

We strongly encourage to apply for the program to everyone who feels called to join, especially to people of all ages with a serious commitment to re-inventing their relationship to Earth and to self, activists, artists, scientists, students, unschoolers, therapists, educators, farmers, community organizers, magicians, dropouts, writers, workers, and everyone resonating with the invitation to be present with the other worlds that are possible and that are already here. 


## Itinerary

Dates: October 23rd-November 4th, 2025

More specific details about the itinerary will be shared soon. 


## Ecopedagogy and travelling

Before, during and after the journey we exercise a cosmopolitical pedagogy of emergence (COPE). We understand cosmopolitics as an exercise of ‘slowing down reasoning’ (Stengers) that creates an opening for possible articulations between worlds. In this sense, it is a pedagogy of encounter, of sourcing inner wisdom, of dialogue between cultures and world-making practices, one that involves movement, story, dreams, inquiries, solidarities, boundaries and practices that allow for the uniqueness of the process of coming into being, of a becoming that invites a new relationship of the human within an entangled, endangered yet potent web of life. 

During the journey, we will have a combination of visits, group process sessions, lectures, practices and free time. Participants are invited to document their journey in the way that suits them better for their learning process.


## Cost

As a cooperative, we are exploring new approaches to make the journeys accessible for as many people as possible while covering the logistical costs involved and honouring the contributions of our faculty, the projects hosting us and the team. 
To support this, we have adopted a sliding scale model - inviting you to choose a fee that reflects your life possibilities. 

**The suggested contribution for this yatra is based on a sliding scale from USD 2000 to USD 3000.**

Consider contributing MORE on the scale if you:

- have the ability to comfortably meet all of your basic needs
- belong to a sponsoring organization or are employed full-time
- have investments, retirement accounts, or inherited money
- travel recreationally
- have access to family money and resources in times of need
- work part-time by choice
- own the home you live in
- have a relatively high degree of earning power due to level of education (or gender and racial privilege, class background, etc.)

Consider contributing LESS on the scale if you.

- have difficulty covering basic expenses
- are supporting children or have other dependents
- have significant debt
- have medical expenses not covered by insurance
- are an elder with limited financial support
- are an unpaid community organizer
- have unstable housing and/or limited access to reliable transportation
- have not taken a vacation or time off due to the financial burden

((This model is inspired by our friends at Re-imagine Education and is based on the ‘Green Bottle’ sliding scale model by Alexis J. Cunningfolk | www.wortsandcunning.com)

If you select an amount at the higher end of the scale, you will make possible future offerings and support the good work of the speakers, facilitators, and organizers who are generously contributing their gifts to this event. You will also be contributing to the partial grants fund for those needing financial support.

We require a non-refundable deposit of $500 USD to book your spot.

## Testimonials of past participants

"Our journey together was the most inspiring, fulfilling, satisfying, and enlivening trip I've ever taken... well, with the exception of being alive and somewhat conscious at this particular time in the Universe. Thank you for this extraordinary co-creation of Imagination, Possibility and Beyond"
Marianne

"Each person we met, each environment we engaged, was more astonishing than the last, making deep impressions on my consciousness about other ways of being. I carry these precious astonishments with me as I go".

## Reasons to participate

You have an interest in:

Becoming present for the Earth in a mutually beneficial way.

Delving into localized wisdom and scientific breakthroughs, exercising presence and exploring old new ways of relating to the web of life, including but not limited to our selves.

Participating in, place-based, embodied, experiential learning that expands sensibilities and imagination.

Cultivating spaces for other ways of knowing and being -aside from mainstream, disembodied, fragmented knowledge- which are highly relevant for the current challenges of our time.

Unfolding a self and collective inquiry leading to the birth of new practices and stories.

Co-creating a space for deepening artistic explorations.

Meeting fellow travelers with similar interests and mutual inspiration .


## Ethics and economy

As a cooperative, we believe in offering programs that help you, your community and the world be enlivened again. We strive to co-create regenerative livelihoods for our families and for the planet. We refuse to engage in deadlihoods and we engage in initiatives that support alivelihoods, regenerating ourselves, the earth’s natural systems and local healthy families and communities.

We adopt the three principles of permaculture: Care for the Earth, Care for the People and Fair Share. We embrace the idea of surplus being shared with everyone involved in making the journey possible. We assign 40% of the profits of the journey to the cooperative, 10% for a local project aligned with this vision, and 50% to be proportionally divided between the team that carried out the project. By participating in this journey, you support an effort to engage with equity and social and environmental justice, supporting localized circular economies, exploring more regenerative economic practices, helping a democratically run cooperative, and enhancing the practice of being a grateful guest of Earth.

![](/assets/img/courses/huaesteca/gerardo.jpg){:.right.thumb width="250"}

**Gerardo López-Amaro**, co-founder of the Enlivened Cooperative, is currently walking  the path of autonomous education with the task of imagining spaces of encounter for thinking-feeling together about ways to strengthen the defense of life, memory and territory. He sees this as part of a planetary struggle for cognitive, relational and ontological justice. He is purposefully becoming entangled in a great “we” of people enacting the pluriverse, that “world where many worlds fit.” Born and raised in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, he’s a pilgrim of viable spaces informed by politics of love and consciousness regarding the healing of land and territory, love and intimacy, and labor and livelihood.
