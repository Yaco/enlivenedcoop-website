# Huasteca journey: embroidery, wise food and celebration of the dead

1. this ordered seed list will be replaced by the toc
{:toc}

## Introduction

The Huasteca is a bioregion of enormous socioecological diversity and significance, home to the Teenek, Nahuat and Xi’oi cultures, nations that have dwelled in the rain forests, waterfalls, caves, mountains and valleys that configure its rich topography. Ancient cities like Tamtok are proof of the complex urbanization systems and the observation of astronomical cycles. The rich oral history and the colorful weaving and embroidery tell the stories of the time before time and the vibrancy of celebrations and rituals announce a respectful way of being in relationship with the land and her sentient beings.
Xantolo is a month-long series of celebrations leading to the Day of the Dead. Dances, food, songs, conversations, art and food are shared throughout this vast region that comprises seven different states. Ancestors are an essential part of the community of life and in this particular period of the year life and death are celebrated as an integral part of one cycle of renewal and disruption, of grief and celebration, of mystery and change.
In this unique  journey we will have the opportunity to engage with local communities involved in the co-creation of initiatives related to agroecology, food sovereignty, art, solidarity economy and activism. We will have the extraordinary opportunity of being hosted mainly by a network of indigenous women that has been active for the past decade in the region.

## Itinerary

Dates: October 23rd-November 4th, 2022

We will meet in the city of San Luis Potosí by noon and will have ground transportation to the Huasteca Region. We will stay in Tanlajás.

#### Monday, October 24th. Tamtok



In the morning, we will travel to Tamtok, one of the most important ancient cities of the Teenek people, where we will have a guided visit by an archaeologist. After replenishing our energy with delicious local food, we will then head back to our accommodation, where we will do an opening ceremony and a River of Life activity.

Tuesday, October 25th. Tamaletom


This day we will visit the contemporary Ceremonial Site of Tamaletom, where a collective of elders, women and youth are dedicating their efforts to make the Teenek ways blossom. We will witness the astonishing Danza del Gavilán, learn about the stories embroidered in the pieces of art created by the women and engage in a conversation with local indigenous leaders. In the evening, we will go back to our hotel in Tanlajás where we will host a reflection circle.

#### Wednesday, October 26th. Tancanhuitz


We will visit different houses of artists, weavers and producers in Tancanhuitz, where we will learn how families are recreating the cosmic stories and the memory of Teenek people, from the way they tend to the land and create their raw materials to the different designs. After sharing locally sourced and cooked food, we will go back to Tanlajás for our reflection circle.

#### Thursday, October 27th. Tamul



This is a day for navigating the Tampaón River, where we will embark on a panga -a small boat- to row as a team and visit the massive, 350-ft waterfall of Tamul. After a refreshing swim, we will enjoy a meal before heading back to our accommodation in Tanlajás.

We will then drive to the south portion of the Huasteca Potosina region.

####Saturday, October 29th. Rest



We will spend a full day of rest, regeneration, and processing in a beautiful cabin in the woods. This will be an opportunity to slow down, digest and pause for a bit in our journey.

## Ecopedagogy and travelling

The values, pedagogy and approach of the Enlivened Cooperative in this journey emphasize:

- Relationality – learning by weaving relations between all learners (including faculty);

- Emplacement – nurturing inquiries, practices and attention towards place (and one´s own place) including the beyond human;

- Cosmopolitical learning \- including many ways of being-knowing-doing-relating, towards human becoming and possible worlds, slowing down reasoning;

- Buen Vivir and Responsibility \- for the common flourishing, alivelihoods and well-being of all beings, which calls for a reinvention of the human and the tending to new stories and practices, particularly of those directly participating in the shared learning experience.


Before the journey, registered participants will get access to a platform with resources on different topics of the journey, such as: Quechua and Aymara culture, history and philosophy, Deep Time perspective, anti-tourism and radical hospitality, Andean ecosystems, archeoastronomy and indigenous peoples resistance to extractivist models of development. These are materials and resources that learners can engage freely, at their own rhythm and with no expected outcome. Participants are invited to choose one topic of inquiry during their journey that is relevant and alive for them.

During the journey, we will have a combination of visits, group process, lectures, practices and free time. Participants are invited to document their journey in the way that suits them better for their learning process.

## Testimonials of past participants

"Our journey together was the most inspiring, fulfilling, satisfying, and enlivening trip I've ever taken... well, with the exception of being alive and somewhat conscious at this particular time in the Universe. Thank you for this extraordinary co-creation of Imagination, Possibility and Beyond"
Marianne

"Each person we met, each environment we engaged, was more astonishing than the last, making deep impressions on my consciousness about other ways of being. I carry these precious astonishments with me as I go".
Terri

## Reasons to participate

## Ethics and economy

As a cooperative, we believe in offering programs that help you, your community and the world be enlivened again. We strive to co-create regenerative livelihoods for our families and for the planet. We refuse to engage in deadlihoods and we engage in initiatives that support alivelihoods, regenerating ourselves, the earth’s natural systems and local healthy families and communities.

We adopt the three principles of permaculture: Care for the Earth, Care for the People and Fair Share. We embrace the idea of surplus being shared with everyone involved in making the journey possible. We assign 40% of the profits of the journey to the cooperative, 10% for a local project aligned with this vision, and 50% to be proportionally divided between the team that carried out the project. By participating in this journey, you support an effort to engage with equity and social and environmental justice, supporting localized circular economies, exploring more regenerative economic practices, helping a democratically run cooperative, and enhancing the practice of being a grateful guest of Earth.

## Faculty and team:

![](/assets/img/courses/huaesteca/huaesteca-04.jpg){:.right.thumb width="250"}

**Gerardo López-Amaro**, co-founder of the Enlivened Cooperative, is currently walking  the path of autonomous education with the task of imagining spaces of encounter for thinking-feeling together about ways to strengthen the defense of life, memory and territory. He sees this as part of a planetary struggle for cognitive, relational and ontological justice. He is purposefully becoming entangled in a great “we” of people enacting the pluriverse, that “world where many worlds fit.” Born and raised in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, he’s a pilgrim of viable spaces informed by politics of love and consciousness regarding the healing of land and territory, love and intimacy, and labor and livelihood.

## About the Interbeing Learning Journeys series

> “If you are a poet, you will see clearly that there is a cloud floating in this sheet of paper. Without a cloud, there will be no rain; without rain, the trees cannot grow: and without trees, we cannot make paper. The cloud is essential for the paper to exist. If the cloud is not here, the sheet of paper cannot be here either. So we can say that the cloud and the paper inter-are.”

**Thich Nhat Hahn, Clouds in Each Paper**

We humans do not exist independently in an isolated triumphant alienated bubble. The Interbeing Learning Journeys are an opportunity to explore interconnected issues of non-anthropocentric time and ways of being, of self and consciousness, of ancient and modern knowledge, following the paths of stars, water, and peoples. In journeying from place to place we also travel within, re-creating new stories and tapping into unknown sensibilities, possibilities and purposes for each participant.

The journeys are for those willing to participate in the co-creation of different stories, dreams and practices, for those searching to expand their horizons and attune their sensibilities and desires, for those daring to entertain an open mind and heart, holding contradictions with authenticity and making space for questions rather than answers. They are for those willing to explore who they really are and how to become present for the Earth in a mutually enhancing way.

This is an invitation for travelers looking to go to the encounter of relations and “worlding practices”, complex interactions between human and non-human beings that constitute, care or disrupt the web of life. It is an opportunity to learn from stars, water, and from people in their vital territories. The main focus of inquiry of travel is to learn what kinds of worlds are enacted, through what practices, and with what consequences for what beings, both in the places we visit and also in the places where the travelers usually dwell.

In times of multiple crises, contradictions and nonsense,

it is important to slow down and take a pause to look at the stars and the messages that they hold about the evolution of the pluriverse, consciousness and life;

it is important to slow down and take a pause to take care of water and the history, flows, and nourishment that she provides for the multiple threads of the web of life in our shared home, our planet;

it is important to slow down and take a pause to listen to the wisdom of people who have cultivated a respectful relationship with the Earth -indigenous peoples, peasants, women, artists and environmentalists- in order to gain emplaced insights about our re-invention as human species; and

it is important to slow down and take a pause to breathe and tap into the rhythms, movements and creations of interbeing, and experience embodied learnings about how to become present for the Earth with reciprocity and care.
