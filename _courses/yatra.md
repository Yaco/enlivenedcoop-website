title: 'Vimukt Shiksha Body Wisdoms Yatra: Movement, Liberation and Embodied Awareness'
description: >
  To reconnect with the body is to enliven the wisdom of the experience. The normativity of the current system of oppression has taught us to judge the body and classify it in sizes and shapes, motivational phrases and even spiritual paths, generalizing people and their processes and alienating too many from their own source of deep communion with the movement of life.

To reconnect with the body is to enliven the wisdom of the experience. The normativity of the current system of oppression has taught us to judge the body and classify it in sizes and shapes, motivational phrases and even spiritual paths, generalizing people and their processes and alienating too many from their own source of deep communion with the movement of life.

Now more than ever, confined into the screen world, it is essential that we challenge this normativity and to inhabit our body awakening consciousness with kindness, patience and care as a practice of self-understanding, learning to relate and communicate in a way that regenerates our severed connection with the body of the Earth.

This journey is an opportunity to explore ways of traveling in and out of the flesh, in beats and sweat, in breath and calm, in rhythm and movement, visiting 7 different projects and approaches virtually -one per day for two hours-  to co-create a space for the recognition of the wisdom of our body, attuning to what we are and not what the imposed normativity wants us to be.

## Dates and times

We will meet online every day for 7 days for 2 hours, starting in August 21st and finishing in August 27th from Time: 10am-12pm ET (7:30 pm-9:30 pm IST).

We will visit a different project every session, have videos, Q&A, reflection, and practices.

For connection after sessions, we will use a platform to share our learnings, questions, proposals and do real-time communication with each other.

## Spaces/Programs we will be exploring

### Saturday August 21st: Clownversity - India

### Sunday August 22nd: TBC

### Monday August 23rd: Continuo Movimiento – Belén Alfaro  – Chile

Movement workshop with a feminist perspective. It is born of the urgency to appropriate and reconnect with our corporeal memory, with our types of corporeality, as a means of activation and personal liberation. We investigate the body-mind-emotion relationship creating maps of the body and its territorial contexts. Above all we move, train and talk about the patriarchy over our bodies.
Non-competitive space, free of machismo, homophobia, transphobia, misogyny.

### Tuesday August 24th: Circo da Lua - Brazil

###  Wednesday August 25th: Creative Movement Association of India
Dance Therapy

### Thursday August 26th: Dani d’Emilia -

### Friday August 27th: Interplay: Tuning in to Inner Wisdom – Vishal and Vibhuti – India

InterPlay is easy, fun, and life changing. It is based in a series of incremental “forms” that lead participants to movement and stories, silence and song, ease and amusement. In the process, we discover the wisdom in ourselves and our communities.
InterPlay integrates body, mind, heart and spirit. Life has become so fragmented. InterPlay helps to pull everything back together so we get more of what we want.

###  Body Wisdoms Yatra

26 August 2021

10am–12pm (EST) / 3–5pm (WEST)
Tuning into queer metabolic sensibilities

Dani d’Emilia and Sarah Amsler

Sensing interconnection with the pluri-body intelligences of vital existence allows us to care for life-giving relationships with ourselves, other beings and the earth of which we are extensions and stewards. The integrated sensibilities of our physical, collective (social and ecological) and metabolic bodies enable us to attune to both the intense suffering and grief caused by modern violence, and the exuberance of creative yearnings to interrupt it and heal. Drawing on the embodied (un)learnings of Dani’s work with Radical Tenderness, insights from Sarah and Dani’s co-inquiry into the wisdoms of queer/cuir metabolic relationality, and psycho-affective pedagogies created by the Gesturing Towards Decolonial Futures Collective, in this session we will explore our present and possible paths of access to this discerning intelligence.

#### Dani d’Emilia

Dani d’Emilia is an artist and educator working in the fields of performance, visual art, devised theatre, radical pedagogy and social-relational justice. Since 2014 Radical Tenderness has been a main guiding force in her political-affective art-life practices. Her work attempts to engage cuir-metabolic sensibilities towards the expansion of intimacies and the deactivation of the logic of separability within ourselves and our wider relations. Dani is a co-founder of the immersive theatre company Living Structures (UK) and the art space Roundabout.lx (PT). She was a core member of the performance collectives La Pocha Nostra (MX/US) and Proyecto Inmiscuir (MX/ES). Dani is a member of the collective Gesturing Towards Decolonial Futures and a collaborator of ANDlab (Research Centre for Art-Thinking & Politics of Togetherness). During 2018-19, with the support of Musagetes Foundation, Dani and Vanessa Andreotti began an artistic-pedagogic investigation entitled ‘Engaged dis-identifications’ which explores the workings of non-notional possibilities of co-existence through performative practices, which they continue to unfold in their collaborations. + info: www.danidemilia.com

#### Sarah Amsler

Sarah Amsler is a researcher, writer and educator. Her work is dedicated to visibilizing and interrupting systems of affective, conceptual, political and relational power that fuel processes of human-inclusive ecological suffering and destruction, particularly through patterns of interpersonal, historical-social, epistemic, ontological, and metabolic violence. Critical analyses of modernity-coloniality and decolonization, transfeminist studies of knowledge and science, queer theory, critical and queer ecologies, material-process philosophies, and affective-somatic practice inform her work to create pedagogies for being and becoming otherwise; expanding radically relational possibility, accountability and response-ability; countering coloniality in education and everyday political-intimate-collective life within post-imperial and settler-colonial contexts as well as translocal communities; and mobilizing embodied biopoethics as one of many pathways towards (re)learning and nurturing inseparable co-existence. She is Associate Professor of Education at the University of Nottingham and a member of the Our Bodhi Project and Gesturing Towards Decolonial Futures art-ecology-research collectives.
