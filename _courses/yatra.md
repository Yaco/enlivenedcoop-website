title: 'Body Wisdoms Yatra: Movement, Liberation and Embodied Awareness'
description: >
  To reconnect with the body is to enliven the wisdom of the experience. The normativity of the current system of oppression has taught us to judge the body and classify it in sizes and shapes, motivational phrases and even spiritual paths, generalizing people and their processes and alienating too many from their own source of deep communion with the movement of life.

To reconnect with the body is to enliven the wisdom of the experience. The normativity of the current system of oppression has taught us to judge the body and classify it in sizes and shapes, motivational phrases and even spiritual paths, generalizing people and their processes and alienating too many from their own source of deep communion with the movement of life.

Now more than ever, confined into the screen world, it is essential that we challenge this normativity and to inhabit our body awakening consciousness with kindness, patience and care as a practice of self-understanding, learning to relate and communicate in a way that regenerates our severed connection with the body of the Earth.

This journey is an opportunity to explore ways of traveling in and out of the flesh, in beats and sweat, in breath and calm, in rhythm and movement, visiting 7 different projects and approaches virtually -one per day for two hours-  to co-create a space for the recognition of the wisdom of our body, attuning to what we are and not what the imposed normativity wants us to be.

## Dates and times

We will meet online every day for 7 days for 2 hours, starting in August 21st and finishing in August 27th from Time: 10am-12pm ET (7:30 pm-9:30 pm IST).

We will visit a different project every session, have videos, Q&A, reflection, and practices.

For connection after sessions, we will use a platform to share our learnings, questions, proposals and do real-time communication with each other.

### As a participant what will I encounter in this course?

* Co-inspire ideas, learnings and collaborations towards re-imagining the possibilities of body wisdom in higher education.

## Program

-----
Saturday August 21st: _Your Inner Clown_ - **Clownversity**. India. Sukhmani Kohli

Your Inner Clown is that active and spontaneous, yet vulnerable and mind-full part of you that gives your most authentic self the license to show up and be, without any fears and judgements. It opens up your creativity and helps you flow through possibilities. Playing, moving, expressing, improvising stories, slowing down and just breathing, playing with sounds and props is what is happening to tap into clowning as a powerful tool to become more self aware and to learn to accept ourselves for who we are. We also see the world from a different point of view- that of empathy and humour.

-----
Sunday August 22nd: _Continuo Movimiento_ - Chile. Belén Alfaro

Practice that strengthens and expands our body / mind awareness assimilating that we are designed to mobilize. We want to find a corporality available to act, within the scenic or personal environment, through the integral understanding of our being. It proposes a space of trust, free of prejudices and skills, we meet to enjoy ourselves and above all to accommodate sensations, listening and your own path for movement.

-----
Monday August 23rd: _Superficie Profunda_. Mexico. Ana Lucía

Superficie Profunda (Deep Surface) is a Somatic Movement Laboratory that seeks an encounter and reencounter with one's own body and its multidirectional perception. Deep surface explores the three-dimensionality of the body that is on the screen, as well as various strategies to express it in a deeper way from the recognition of body tissues that help us to rebuild our sides and our back, and with this awareness, the inside. from which (we) inhabit.

Deep Surface, based on the principles of Shin Somatics Movement, is the result of a long research on how new technologies affect the perception of and from our own body and therefore of our being in the world, activating a body capable of expressing itself from places that, more and more, escape to everyday life.

-----
Tuesday August 24th: _Yoga do Riso_. **Circo da Lua** - Brazil

Yoga do Riso is a moment that brings aspects of the circus universe, especially clowning, to the practice of Yoga.

Yoga is a philosophy of life of more than 5,000 years that seeks to unite body, mind and spirit, enabling people to reconnect with their true essence. The smile helps maintain emotional balance, keeps us more relaxed, increases self-esteem and high spirits. When good humor and laughter are shared they unite people, increase intimacy and, of course, contribute to the state of happiness.

-----
Wednesday August 25th: - _Dance Movement Therapy_. **Creative Movement Therapy Association of India**. India. Tripura Kashyap

This workshop is designed to experience a mix of fun-filled movement activities, icebreakers and energizers that are creative, expressive and therapeutic. Adapted to the virtual medium, activities have been sourced from creative /classical /contemporary dance to contribute to the mental health and well-being of participants. We will experience small bytes of theory alongside cultivating our personal body language geared towards increasing self-expression and self-confidence while releasing stress and emotional tensions.

Dance Movement Therapy (DMT also known as Creative Movement Therapy) is a psychotherapeutic framework that works with the mind-body connection to use personal movement language and dance for the health and wellness of an individual’s physical, emotional, cognitive, social and behavioral aspects.- (CMTAI,2019)

-----
Thursday August 26th: _Tuning into queer metabolic sensibilities_. **Gesturing Towards Decolonial Futures**. Portugal and UK - Dani d’Emilia and Sarah Amsler.

Sensing interconnection with the pluri-body intelligences of vital existence allows us to care for life-giving relationships with ourselves, other beings and the earth of which we are extensions and stewards. The integrated sensibilities of our physical, collective (social and ecological) and metabolic bodies enable us to attune to both the intense suffering and grief caused by modern violence, and the exuberance of creative yearnings to interrupt it and heal. Drawing on the embodied (un)learnings of Dani’s work with Radical Tenderness, insights from Sarah and Dani’s co-inquiry into the wisdoms of queer/cuir metabolic relationality, and psycho-affective pedagogies created by the Gesturing Towards Decolonial Futures Collective, in this session we will explore our present and possible paths of access to this discerning intelligence.

-----
Friday August 27th: _Interplay: Tuning in to Inner Wisdom_ – India. Vishal and Vibhuti

In the modern world, we have lost touch with our bodies and the entire focus is on the mind. Through this experience, we hope to help you tune into your body wisdom and reclaim the playfulness in life. InterPlay is easy, fun, and life changing. It is based in a series of incremental “forms” that lead participants to movement and stories, silence and song, ease and amusement. In the process, we discover the wisdom in ourselves and our communities. InterPlay integrates body, mind, heart and spirit.

I recognize myself as a creator and scenic interpreter, I develop as a theater pedagogue specialized in the area of ​​movement. I am interested in creating from mixed languages, between theatricality, dance and performance. During the last years, the various experiences have made me understand our corporeity as an integral, active and singular place, getting closer and closer to the study, training and art of the body. Our body is not an instrument, we do not have a body, but rather we are body, we are movement.

She is a researcher, writer and educator. Her work is dedicated to visibilizing and interrupting systems of affective, conceptual, political and relational power that fuel processes of human-inclusive ecological suffering and destruction, particularly through patterns of interpersonal, historical-social, epistemic, ontological, and metabolic violence. Critical analyses of modernity-coloniality and decolonization, transfeminist studies of knowledge and science, queer theory, critical and queer ecologies, material-process philosophies, and affective-somatic practice inform her work to create pedagogies for being and becoming otherwise; expanding radically relational possibility, accountability and response-ability; countering coloniality in education and everyday political-intimate-collective life within post-imperial and settler-colonial contexts as well as translocal communities; and mobilizing embodied biopoethics as one of many pathways towards (re)learning and nurturing inseparable co-existence.
