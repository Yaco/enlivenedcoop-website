# Interbeing Learning Journey Yucatán (Spring edition)

1. this ordered seed list will be replaced by the toc
{:toc}

The Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico is a privileged witness of the last mass extinction event, caused by the impact of the Chicxulub asteroid. It shelters the mysteries of cosmic events sculpted as cenotes, windows to the underground. Jungles, lagoons and the ocean are home to vibrant and endangered communities of life. Similarly, it preserves the memories of ancient cities built by peoples who were and are some of the most prestigious observers of the stars and life cycles, the Mayans.

Embraced by the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, the Peninsula has a strong relationship with rich and threatened marine ecosystems, including the second largest coral reef in the world, the Banco Chinchorro.

The Yucatan is home to an intercultural society facing very complex challenges. The economy is driven by extractivist tourism, attracting crowds enchanted by the beauties of the jungles, beaches, and villages of this region while overlooking the damage of a development model that is polluting on a vast scale, devastating mangroves and jungles, endangering species and ecosystems, and deepening social inequalities and injustice.

This is an invitation to undoing tourism and development and a provocation to learn to be good visitors, setting aside the Western sense of neo-colonizing entitlement and focusing on the attuning of sensibilities, journeying together, holding the inevitable contradictions and caring for the nourishment of local communities, land and waters that will host us, as well as for the lands and waters where we travelers usually dwell.

## Ecopedagogy and travelling

The values, pedagogy and approach of the Enlivened Cooperative in this journey emphasize:

* _Relationality_ – learning by weaving relations between all learners (including faculty);
* _Emplacement_ – nurturing inquiries, practices and attention towards place (and one´s own place) including the beyond human;
* _Cosmopolitical learning_ - including many ways of being-knowing-doing-relating, towards human becoming and possible worlds, slowing down reasoning;
* _Buen Vivir and Responsibility_ - for the common flourishing, alivelihoods and well-being of all beings, which calls for a reinvention of the human and the tending to new stories and practices, particularly of those directly participating in the shared learning experience.

Before the journey, registered participants will get access to a platform with resources on different topics of the journey, such as: Mayan culture, the Chicxulub event, Deep Time perspective, anti-tourism and radical hospitality, marine life ecosystems, archeoastronomy and indigenous peoples resistance to extractivist models of development. These are materials and resources that learners can engage freely, at their own rhythm and with no expected outcome. Participants are invited to choose one topic of inquiry during their journey that is relevant and alive for them.

During the journey, we will have a combination of visits, group process, lectures, practices and free time. Participants are invited to document their journey in the way that suits them better for their learning process.

We adopt the three principles of permaculture: Care for the Earth, Care for the People and Fair Share. We embrace the idea of surplus being shared with everyone involved in making the journey possible. We assign 40% of the profits of the journey to the cooperative, 10% for a local project aligned with this vision, and 50% to be proportionally divided between the team that carried out the project.
By participating in this journey, you support an effort to engage with equity and social and environmental justice, supporting localized circular economies, exploring more regenerative economic practices, helping a democratically run cooperative, and enhancing the practice of being a grateful guest of Earth.

## Faculty and team:

![](/assets/img/courses/yucatan_fall/amaro.jpg){:.right.thumb width="250"}

**Gerardo López-Amaro**, co-founder of the Enlivened Cooperative, is currently walking com-passionately the path of autonomous education with the task of imagining spaces of encounter for thinking-feeling together about ways to strengthen the defense of life, memory and territory. He sees this as part of a planetary struggle for cognitive, relational and ontological justice. He is purposefully becoming entangled in a great “we” of people enacting the pluriverse, that “world where many worlds fit.” He has a profound interest in intercultural translation as a political practice with the horizon of weaving together an anti-imperial, decolonizing, joyful South that can resist the current capitalist storm and create stories, practices, and ideas that nurture life and dignity. Born and raised in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, he’s a pilgrim of viable spaces informed by politics of love and consciousness regarding the healing of land and territory, love and intimacy, and labor and livelihood. These topics constitute his field of inquiry for his doctoral dissertation research in Anthropology and Social Change at the California Institute of Integral Studies.

**Udi Mandel** has 20 years of experience teaching social anthropology and sustainability in higher education and collaborating with communities in Europe, the Pacific, North and Latin America. Udi’s focus is on issues of social, ecological and epistemic justice with an emphasis on regenerative practices that can bring human and ecological flourishing. Udi’s work combines action research, writing, filmmaking and community collaborations in a range of settings,  including diverse indigenous communities, social and ecological movements from around the world. Udi received his PhD in social anthropology from Goldsmiths College (University of London), an MSc in international development from the University of Bristol, and an MFA from the University of Edinburgh. Udi has held faculty appointments at EARTH University (Costa Rica), the University of Bristol (UK), and the University of Oxford and other institutions in the UK and US. Udi co-founded with others the Enlivened Learning Project and the Ecoversities Alliance, an international alliance of learning places committed to social and ecological justice and regeneration. Udi is also a co-founder of the Enlivened Cooperative.

**Bernardo Sánchez Lapuente** is a Social Anthropologist, Theater Educator and Photographer. Beyond titles and credentials, Bernardo is an Artist, Dad of two awesome girls, traveler and world bridger. He develops his work within the framework of Art Education with kids and youth, as well as accompanying group processes.

He will be in charge of generating spaces and moments to put into common ground the discoveries and questions of the journey.

**Lupita de la Rosa**, President and Founder of Moce Yax Cuxtal, a local, women-led environmentalist organization dedicated to creating ecological programs in the urban area of Playa del Carmen and neighboring areas.

**Pedro Uc Be** is a poet and a defender of the Mayan territory in Yucatan. Born in Buctzotz, he is the author of several books and a recipient of different awards. For Pedro, poetry and the care for the land are the same, a deep root that is entangled to his relationship to the milpa. His proposal is to share Mayan philosophy, thought and emotion a a proposal of life, of survival, of joy and of health.

**Haizel de la Cruz**, Born in Ticul and currently living in Buctzotz. A young photographer that documents the Mayan resistance and the vitality of an ethics of care for life. A ceiba tree, that represents life, time, space and community for Mayan was the first image that she captured with her cellphone. And her world moved.

**Bernardo Caamal Itzá** is a referent of the Mayan culture of Yucatan. Born in Peto, he left his hometown in 1989 to pursue an agronomy degree at the Universidad Autónoma de Chapingo. Upon completion of his studies, he came back home ‘as promised’, where his mother and the milpa were waiting for him. For the past 26 years, he has worked with pleasure positioning ‘our philosophy of life, between wind and tides’, collaborating with indigenous and peasant populations in the process of knowing better the milpa and developing the Xok K’iin, an agroecological calendar in times of climate emergency.

## About the Interbeing Learning Journeys series

> "If you are a poet, you will see clearly that there is a cloud floating in this sheet of paper. Without a cloud, there will be
> no rain; without rain, the trees cannot grow: and without trees, we cannot make paper. The cloud is essential for the paper to
> exist. If the cloud is not here, the sheet of paper cannot be here either. So we can say that the cloud and the paper
>inter-are."

_Thich Nhat Hahn, Clouds in Each Paper_

We humans do not exist independently in an isolated triumphant alienated bubble. The Interbeing Learning Journeys are an
opportunity to explore interconnected issues of non-anthropocentric time and ways of being, of self and consciousness, of
ancient and modern knowledge, following the paths of stars, water, and peoples. In journeying from place to place we also travel
within, re-creating new stories and tapping into unknown sensibilities, possibilities and purposes for each participant.

The journeys are for those willing to participate in the co-creation of different stories, dreams and practices, for those
searching to expand their horizons and attune their sensibilities and desires, for those daring to entertain an open mind and
heart, holding contradictions with authenticity and making space for questions rather than answers. They are for those willing
to explore who they really are and how to become present for the Earth in a mutually enhancing way.

This is an invitation for travelers looking to go to the encounter of relations and “worlding practices”, complex interactions
between human and non-human beings that constitute, care or disrupt the web of life. It is an opportunity to learn from stars,
water, and from people in their vital territories. The main focus of inquiry of travel is to learn what kinds of worlds are
enacted, through what practices, and with what consequences for what beings, both in the places we visit and also in the places
where the travelers usually dwell.

In times of multiple crises, contradictions and nonsense,

it is important to slow down and take a pause to look at the stars and the messages that they hold about the evolution of the
pluriverse, consciousness and life;

it is important to slow down and take a pause to take care of water and the history, flows, and nourishment that she provides
for the multiple threads of the web of life in our shared home, our planet;

it is important to slow down and take a pause to listen to the wisdom of people who have cultivated a respectful relationship
with the Earth -indigenous peoples, peasants, women, artists and environmentalists- in order to gain emplaced insights about our
re-invention as human species; and

it is important to slow down and take a pause to breathe and tap into the rhythms, movements and creations of interbeing, and
experience embodied learnings about how to become present for the Earth with reciprocity and care.
