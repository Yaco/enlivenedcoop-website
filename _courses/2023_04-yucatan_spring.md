# Interbeing Learning Journey Yucatán (Spring edition)

1. this ordered seed list will be replaced by the toc
{:toc}

Experience a transformative journey where you will delve into the Maya ethics and practice of joy and health for a world woven into multiple kinships. You will meet local leaders in the fields of environmental conservation, medicine, food, spirituality, native seeds, art and memory. As a group, we will let ourselves be entangled with the jungles, ancient cities, cenotes, caves and beaches, while deepening our understanding of our selves, journeying and un/learning. 

## What is an un/learning journey?

The raw material of an un/learning journey is time. With care, we curate, knead, craft and, sometimes, even co-create it. 

They are an interruption, a slowing down, many openings. 

They are brave passages to possibilities, invitations to go out of the familiar zone and expand our sensibilities to let ourselves be undone so that we can suspend the noise of the routine and be attuned to dreams, stories and practices that instigate a process of becoming guided by the calm whisper and the joyous dance of the Earth. 

Unlike tourism, this is not about consuming experiences, places, or people. 

It is about engaging with the land and her guardians (human, non-human, more-than-human). 

It is about activating the memory that walks to the encounter of what is different -tastes, landscapes, textures, languages, rhythms, ways of knowing, modes of being- with curiosity and respect. 

The journey is simultaneously a retreat, a ceremony and a ritual that embraces the unknown as a fertile soil for radicalizing imagination and a pathway to deepen the relations to self, life, consciousness and the many worlds that constitute the pluriverse. 

## Who is this for?

The journeys are for those willing to participate in the co-creation of different stories, dreams and practices, for those searching to expand their horizons and attune their sensibilities and desires, for those daring to entertain an open mind and heart, holding contradictions with authenticity and making space for questions rather than answers. They are for those willing to explore who they really are and how to become present for the Earth in a mutually enhancing way.

We strongly encourage to apply for the program to everyone who feels called to join, especially to people of all ages with a serious commitment to re-inventing their relationship to Earth and to self, activists, artists, scientists, students, unschoolers, therapists, educators, farmers, community organizers, magicians, dropouts, writers, workers, and everyone resonating with the invitation to be present with the other worlds that are possible and that are already here.

![](/assets/img/courses/yucatan_fall/itinerary.png){:.thumb}

## Ecopedagogy and travelling

Before, during and after the journey we exercise a cosmopolitical pedagogy of emergence (COPE). We understand cosmopolitics as an exercise of ‘slowing down reasoning’ (Stengers) that creates an opening for possible articulations between worlds. In this sense, it is a pedagogy of encounter, of sourcing inner wisdom, of dialogue between cultures and world-making practices, one that involves movement, story, dreams, inquiries, solidarities, boundaries and practices that allow for the uniqueness of the process of coming into being, of a becoming that invites a new relationship of the human within an entangled, endangered yet potent web of life. 

Before the journey, registered participants will get access to a platform with resources on different topics of the journey, such as: Maya culture, the Chicxulub event, Deep Time perspective, anti-tourism and radical hospitality, marine life ecosystems, archeoastronomy and indigenous peoples resistance to extractivist models of development. These are materials and resources that learners can engage freely, at their own rhythm and with no expected outcome. Participants are invited to choose one topic of inquiry during their journey that is relevant and alive for them.

During the journey, we will have a combination of visits, group process sessions, lectures, practices and free time. Participants are invited to document their journey in the way that suits them better for their learning process.

## Cost

As a cooperative, we are trying new approaches to make the journeys affordable for as many people as possible while covering the costs and paying our faculty and hosts. We are experimenting with a sliding scale in which you can choose the fee according to your life situation. 

Consider contributing MORE on the scale if you:

- have the ability to comfortably meet all of your basic needs
- belong to a sponsoring organization or are employed full-time
- have investments, retirement accounts, or inherited money
- travel recreationally
- have access to family money and resources in times of need
- work part-time by choice
- own the home you live in
- have a relatively high degree of earning power due to level of education (or gender and racial privilege, class background, etc.)

Consider contributing LESS on the scale if you.

- have difficulty covering basic expenses
- are supporting children or have other dependents
- have significant debt
- have medical expenses not covered by insurance
- are an elder with limited financial support
- are an unpaid community organizer
- have unstable housing and/or limited access to reliable transportation
- have not taken a vacation or time off due to the financial burden

(This is based on the ‘Green Bottle’ sliding scale model by Alexis J. Cunningfolk | www.wortsandcunning.com)

**Gerardo López-Amaro**, co-founder of the Enlivened Cooperative, is currently walking com-passionately the path of autonomous education with the task of imagining spaces of encounter for thinking-feeling together about ways to strengthen the defense of life, memory and territory. He sees this as part of a planetary struggle for cognitive, relational and ontological justice. He is purposefully becoming entangled in a great “we” of people enacting the pluriverse, that “world where many worlds fit.” He has a profound interest in intercultural translation as a political practice with the horizon of weaving together an anti-imperial, decolonizing, joyful South that can resist the current capitalist storm and create stories, practices, and ideas that nurture life and dignity. Born and raised in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, he’s a pilgrim of viable spaces informed by politics of love and consciousness regarding the healing of land and territory, love and intimacy, and labor and livelihood. These topics constitute his field of inquiry for his doctoral dissertation research in Anthropology and Social Change at the California Institute of Integral Studies.

**Guardianes de las Semillas** promotes native seeds and local knowledge about agroecological cycles and practices for food sovereignty in the peninsula of Yucatan. The collective is formed by Maya women and men that work in the milpa and that are commited to conserving the biocultural legacy of the milpa, basis of their diet and cosmovision. 

**Haizel de la Cruz**, Born in Ticul and currently living in Buctzotz. A young photographer that documents the Mayan resistance and the vitality of an ethics of care for life. A ceiba tree, that represents life, time, space and community for Mayan was the first image that she captured with her cellphone. And her world moved.

**Mauro Barrientos** born and raised in the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, he has been guiding archaeological and nature tours for 10 years. 

![](/assets/img/courses/yucatan_fall/mon.jpeg){:.right.thumb width="250"}

**Mon Fernández** Mon is a young activist specialized in a politics of care for life. From that space she moves, accompanies and promotes the rights of women and disidences, the conservation of the jungle biodiversity and the processes of free education for children, among other threads that weave her lifepath.

**Pedro Uc Be** is a poet and a defender of the Mayan territory in Yucatan. Born in Buctzotz, he is the author of several books and a recipient of different awards. For Pedro, poetry and the care for the land are the same, a deep root that is entangled to his relationship to the milpa. His proposal is to share Mayan philosophy, thought and emotion a a proposal of life, of survival, of joy and of health.
